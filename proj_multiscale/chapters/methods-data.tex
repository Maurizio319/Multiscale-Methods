\subsection{Data used for the project} \label{methods: data used}
The data of CTCF and ATAC for the IMR90 cell line included in the paper written by Jimin and colleagues in 2023 about the Origami simulation tool
\cite{tanCelltypespecificPrediction3D2023}
were used for the project (see table \ref{tab:data}).

\begin{table}[H]

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Cell-Type} & \textbf{CTCF ChiP-seq} & \textbf{ATAC-seq}\\
        \hline
        IMR90 & ENCSR000EFI & ENCSR200OML\\

    \caption{Table referring to the data used for the analysis. All of them were used for the training also of the Origami\cite{tanCelltypespecificPrediction3D2023} model. The written entries are for the ENCODE database\cite{encodeprojectconsortiumIntegratedEncyclopediaDNA2012}.}

The analyzed region was ANPEP in IMR90, taking into account the bases between the 89'000'000th and the 91'000'000.
