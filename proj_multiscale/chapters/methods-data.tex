\subsection{Data used for the project} \label{methods: data used}
The data of CTCF and ATAC for the IMR90 cell line, included in the paper written by Jimin and colleagues in 2023
\cite{tanCelltypespecificPrediction3D2023},
were used for the project (see table \ref{tab:data}). It was decided to use the same data of \textit{Origami} to allow a better comparison between its predictions and those produced by our modelling.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Cell-Type} & \textbf{CTCF ChiP-seq} & \textbf{ATAC-seq}\\
        \hline
        IMR90 & ENCSR000EFI & ENCSR200OML\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Table referring to the data used for the analysis. All of them were used for the training of the Origami\cite{tanCelltypespecificPrediction3D2023} model. The written entries can be found in the ENCODE database\cite{encodeprojectconsortiumIntegratedEncyclopediaDNA2012}.}
    \label{tab:data}
\end{table}

The ATAC-sequencing data were produced by following the standard ENCODE procedure
\cite{ATACseqUnreplicatedENCODE}. 
In particular, the processes of read trimming, alignment, and filtering were performed making use of the \textit{Bowtie 2}, \textit{Samtools}, \textit{Sambamba}, \textit{Picard} and \textit{cutadapt} sofwares
\cite{j.michaelcherryATACSeqPipeline}. 
An explanation of the processes could be found in the work made by Feng Y. and colleagues in 2020
\cite{yanReadsInsightHitchhiker2020}.

When it comes to the ChIP-seq data, again, the standard procedure of ENCODE was used to produce the online available data. An overview can be found at the following \href{https://www.encodeproject.org/chip-seq/transcription_factor/}{link}
\cite{TranscriptionFactorChIPseq}.
To sum up, at first the reference genome was indexed with the \textit{BWA}, then, the alignments between the reads and the reference genome (hg38
\cite{HomoSapiensGenome})
were produced and filtered with the \textit{BWA}, \textit{Samtools}, \textit{Picard}, \textit{BEDTools}, \textit{Phantompeakqualtools} and \textit{SPP} softwares.

%#TODO make a better description of the methods maybe

In the case of our study, the analyzed region included ANPEP, and it was taken from the $89,000,000^{\text{th}}$ base to the $91,000,000^{\text{th}}$ position.
