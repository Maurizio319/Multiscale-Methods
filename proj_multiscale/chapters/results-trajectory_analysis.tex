\subsection{Trajectory analysis results} \label{chap: trajectory analysis results}

Results from the RMSD analysis are reported in figure \ref{fig:RMSD first replicate} and \ref{fig:RMSD collective replicates}. The $R_g$ results are instead plotted in images \ref{fig:RG first replicate} and \ref{fig:RG collective replicates}. Finally the autocorrelation function graphs are reported in \ref{fig:autocorrelation function first replicate} and \ref{fig:autocorrelation function collective replicates}. Although the RMSD seems to be less variable and the $R_g$ profile, in reality the interval is approximately large the same. By looking to the RMSD profile, it can be argued that the final distension is obtained at the $50^{\text{th}}$ frame, which corresponds to the $50 * 50000 = 2,500,000$ step. I insist in saying that, right now, there are no interactions between the beads of the polymer. As a consequence, the equilibrium that we think we obtained is due to the reaching of the maximal and most stable extension of the chain.
