\subsection{ChromHMM allows the sequential characterization of DNA regions}
ChromHMM is a tool which helps in the annotation of genomic DNA by using epigenomic information
\cite{ernstChromatinstateDiscoveryGenome2017}
. The way it learns chromatin states signatures by using a multivariate hidden Markov model: In each genomic position, it returns the most probable chromatinic state (segments) and other useful information, such as the emission/transition parameters of the states, the abundance of the states at the TSS (Transcriptional Starting Site), at the TES (Transcriptional Ending site), and other important portions of the genome (CPG islands, exons, genes). In the case of my study, ChromHMM was used to
