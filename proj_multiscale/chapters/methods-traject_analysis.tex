\subsection{Trajectories analysis} \label{chap: trajectory analysis}

Three types of analysis were performed (all the terms are explained in the Glossary): %#TODO don't know if it's necessary to specify this

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{\textit{RMSD}}: The Root Mean Square Deviation is calculated by using the \textit{MDanalysis} package
    \cite{gowersMDAnalysisPythonPackage2016}
    and is calculated as follows:

    \begin{equation} \label{eq: RMSD}
        RMSD = \rho(t) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N{w_i \left(\vec{x_i}(t) - \vec{x_i}^{REF}\right)^2}}
    \end{equation}

    Before performing this type of calculation, the structures were aligned to the first frame (each frame of each replicate was aligned to the first frame of their specific replicate). This type of alignment was done making use of the \textit{AlignTraj} function
    \cite{gowersMDAnalysisPythonPackage2016}
    . In general, the smaller is the difference between two structures, the lower is the value of RMSD. The results are written in graph \ref{fig:RMSD first replicate} and \ref{fig:RMSD collective replicates}.

    \item \textbf{$R_g$}: The Radius of Gyration computed by \textit{MDanalysis} was calculated as written in equation \ref{eq: radius of gyration}. This quantity is a measure of how the mass of an object is spread out relative to a particular axis of rotation. In general, it tells "how spherical" is an object
    \cite{gowersMDAnalysisPythonPackage2016,tuckermanStatisticalMechanicsTheory2015}
    . The results are written in graph \ref{fig:RG first replicate} and \ref{fig:RG collective replicates}.
    

    \begin{equation} \label{eq: radius of gyration}
        R_g = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_i{m_i \vec{r_i}^2}}{\sum_i{m_i}}}    
    \end{equation}


    \item \textit{\textbf{Autocorrelation function:}} The autocorrelation function can be written as shown in equation \ref{eq: autocorrelation}
    \cite{sumaElectricFieldDrivenTrappingPolyelectrolytes2018}
    . The results are shown in graphs \ref{fig:autocorrelation function first replicate} and \ref{fig:autocorrelation function collective replicates}. 
    
    \begin{equation} \label{eq: autocorrelation}
      r_k = \frac{C_k}{C_0} = \frac{\frac{1}{M} \sum_{t = 1}^{M - k}{(A_t - \bar{A})(A_{t+k} - \bar{A})}}{\frac{1}{M} \sum_{t = 1}^{M - k}{(A_t - \bar{A})^2}}
    \end{equation}

    Where $C_k = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{t = 1}^{M - k}{(A_t - \bar{A})(A_{t+k} - \bar{A})}$ is the autocovariance function at lag k and $C_0 = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{t = 1}^{M - k}{(A_t - \bar{A})^2}$ is the variance function.
    
\end{enumerate}
