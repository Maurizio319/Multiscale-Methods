\section{Aim of the project} \label{chap: aim}

The current project is a part of the thesis work, whose aim is to predict chromatin matrices of contact through the results obtained with molecular coarse-grained simulations of 2 Mb long chains. Our focus was in particular placed on a region including and sorrounding the ANPEP \textit{locus}, starting at position $89,000,000$, and finish at the $91,000,000^{\text{th}}$ base of the $15^\text{th}$. The type of system that was generated had beads incorporating 5000 bp.
As a last step, which has still to be done, a comparison between this modelling approach and others currently available, such as \textit{Hip-Hop} and \textit{cOrigami}
\cite{bucklePolymerSimulationsHeteromorphic2018,tanCelltypespecificPrediction3D2023},
would give us a better idea about the potential of the proposed method.\\
The scope of this work, and specifically of this report, is also to gather opinions and useful feedbacks to improve the project, which will continue during the next months.
