The project is part of the thesis whose aim is to predict matrices of contact of chromatin through the results obtained with molecular coarse-grained simulations of 2 Mb portions of the chromatin.
The scope of the report is also to gather opinions and useful feedback to improve the thesis work, which will continue for another two months.
