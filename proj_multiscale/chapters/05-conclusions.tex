\section{CONCLUSIONS}

%#TODO add repulsive interactions

As a future perspective, it could be considered the extension of the analysis towards new cell-types and/or new \textit{loci}. In particular, we would be interested in investigating the MYC, SOX9, ITG45, MSX2, NT5E genes, and the GM12878 cell-type.
Additionally, the results obtained with the model could be compared to those resulting from other very interesing simulation softwares, such as \textit{Origami} and \textit{Hip-Hop}
\cite{bucklePolymerSimulationsHeteromorphic2018,tanCelltypespecificPrediction3D2023}.
