\subsection{Finding enriched states in 5 kbs long beads} \label{methods: finding enriched states}

To find the enriched states in 5 kb long bins, the procedure described in process \ref{algo: enriched states} was followed. The fold change of a state within a bin was determined by dividing the proportion in the bin by the corresponding proportion in the chromosome. Once done that, the state with the highest fold-change was assigned to the bin. A visual investigation was performed afterwards to check the quality of the "binarization" procedure making use of the IGV visualization software
\cite{robinsonIgvJsEmbeddable2020}.

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{Finding enriched states in 5-kb long bins}\label{algo: enriched states}
    \KwResult{Enriched states}
    \ForAll{chromosomes}{Find proportions of the states in the chromosome}
    \ForEach{bin}{
        Calculate bin proportions for each state\\
        Compute the fold changes\\
        Assign the state with the highest fold change
    }
    Generate .bed files\\
    Visualization in IGV of regions of interests\\
    \tcc{each bin is 5 kb long}
\end{algorithm}

%#TODO maybe it would be the case to talk about other possibilities
