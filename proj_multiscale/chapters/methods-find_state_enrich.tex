\subsection{Finding enriched states in 5 kbs long beads}

To find the enriched states, the procedure in process \ref{algo: enriched states} was followed. The fold change for a state in a bin was found by taking the ratio of the proportion in the specific chromosome and in the bin. Once done that, the state with the highest fold-change was assigned to the bin.


\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{Finding enriched states in 5-kb long bins}\label{algo: enriched states}
    \KwResult{Enriched states}
    $n = 0$\;
    \ForAll{chromosomes}{Find proportions of the states in the chromosome}
    \ForEach{bin}{
        Calculate bin proportions for each state
        Compute the fold changes
        Assign the state with the highest fold change
    }
    Generate .bed files

%#TODO maybe it would be the case to talk about other possibilities
