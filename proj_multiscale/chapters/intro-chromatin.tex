\subsection{Chromatin as the information center of a cell}
All the living organisms possess DNA, which is the main molecule through which information are passed from a generation to another. Chromatin is contained inside the nucleus in an ordered manner
\cite{paroBiologyChromatin2021}
. DNA is wrapped around histones forming nucleosomes. Throughout the report, I will call the nucleomes beads, which is a term that underlines the spherical shape of the DNA-histone complex.
DNA and histones are subjected to different modifications; among those, methylation is the most important modification involving DNA. Methylation in mammals occurs in specific
sites of the genome, called CpGs, where a cyto-
sine is connected directly to a guanine. Methy-
lations of regulatory elements have been im-
plicated in determining cell identity and chro-
matin structure
\cite{liauAdaptiveChromatinRemodeling2017a, shareefExtendedrepresentationBisulfiteSequencing2021}
. CTCF is a protein conserved in eukariotes and is ubiquitous in mammalians
\cite{kimCTCFMultifunctionalProtein2015a}
. It contains a Zync-finger which binds to DNA. The act of binding is performed in cooperation with cohesins, and causes the folding of the chromatin.
