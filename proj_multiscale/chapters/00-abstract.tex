\section{ABSTRACT}

The chromatin is one of the most important parts of a cell. In fact, it contains in its volume the largest part of the cell DNA, and a great number of proteins, such as the histones, which adiuvate in the functional compaction of the nuclear DNA. However, the direct study of this substance encounters significant difficulties, and the analysis of related data do not give straightforward results. All-atomistic approaches to predict the conformations of the chromatin in time are completelyThe aim of this project is to predict Hi-C matrices of contact by using molecular dynamics simulations
