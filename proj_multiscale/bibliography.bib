However, we lack a functional understanding of the sequence features that control the activity and cell-type-specific features of these CREs. Here, we used lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assays (lentiMPRAs) to test the regulatory activity of over 680,000 sequences, representing a nearly comprehensive set of all annotated CREs among three cell types (HepG2, K562, and WTC11), finding 41.7\% to be functional. By testing sequences in both orientations, we find promoters to have significant strand orientation effects. We also observe that their 200 nucleotide cores function as non-cell-type-specific `on switches' providing similar expression levels to their associated gene. In contrast, enhancers have weaker orientation effects, but increased tissue-specific characteristics. Utilizing our lentiMPRA data, we develop sequence-based models to predict CRE function with high accuracy and delineate regulatory motifs. Testing an additional lentiMPRA library encompassing 60,000 CREs in all three cell types, we further identified factors that determine cell-type specificity. Collectively, our work provides an exhaustive catalog of functional CREs in three widely used cell lines, and showcases how large-scale functional measurements can be used to dissect regulatory grammar.},

For proteins that interact multivalently, we obtain a phase diagram which includes liquid-like droplets, droplets with absorbed polymer, and coated polymer regimes. Of particular interest is a regime where protein droplets only form due to interaction with the polymer; here, unlike a standard phase separating system, droplet density rather than size varies with the overall protein concentration. We also observe that protein dynamics within droplets slow down as chromatin is absorbed. If the protein-protein interactions have a strictly limited valence, fractal or gel-like condensates are instead observed. A specific example that inspired our model is heterochromatin protein 1, or HP1. Recent in~vivo experiments have shown that HP1 exhibits similar droplet size buffering behavior as our simulations. Overall, our results provide biologically relevant insights into the general nature of protein-chromatin condensates in living cells.},

Our analysis detected EPIN clusters enriched with the architectural protein CTCF, a regulator of enhancer-promoter interactions. CTCF presence was coupled with the prevalence of prostate cancer (PrCa) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the same EPIN clusters, suggesting functional implications in PrCa. Within the EPINs displaying enrichments in both CTCF and PrCa SNPs, we also show enrichment in oncogenes. We substantiated our identified SNPs through CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and RNAi screens experiments. Here we show that PENGUIN provides insights into the intricate interplay between enhancer-promoter interactions and PPI networks, which are crucial for identifying key genes and potential intervention targets.

Although the contribution of chromatin in DNA repair has been investigated1,2, the contribution of chromosome folding to these processes remains unclear3. Here we report that, after the production of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells, ATM drives the formation of a new chromatin compartment (D compartment) through the clustering of damaged topologically associating domains, decorated with {$\gamma$}H2AX and 53BP1. This compartment forms by a mechanism that is consistent with polymer--polymer phase separation rather than liquid--liquid phase separation. The D compartment arises mostly in G1 phase, is independent of cohesin and is enhanced after pharmacological inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) or R-loop accumulation. Importantly, R-loop-enriched DNA-damage-responsive genes physically localize to the D compartment, and this contributes to their optimal activation, providing a function for DSB clustering in the DNA damage response. However, DSB-induced chromosome reorganization comes at the expense of an increased rate of translocations, also observed in cancer genomes. Overall, we characterize how DSB-induced compartmentalization orchestrates the DNA damage response and highlight the critical impact of chromosome architecture in genomic instability.},

This simple polymer model recapitulates the scaling properties of chromatin folding reported experimentally in different cellular systems, the fractal state of chromatin, the processes of domain formation, and looping out.

The KSHV replication and transcription activator viral protein, encoded from open reading frame 50 (ORF50), is the key viral protein which drives the switch between the latent and lytic phases (Guito and Lukac, 2012). We have recently demonstrated that KSHV manipulates the host cell N6-methyl adenosine (m6A) RNA modification pathway to enhance viral gene expression. Specifically, we have shown that the KSHV ORF50 transcript is m6A methylated, allowing the recruitment of the m6A reader protein, Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1 (SND1), resulting in the stabilisation of the ORF50 transcript and efficient KSHV lytic replication (Baquero-Perez et al. 2019). Further analysis of the m6A modified site with the ORF50 transcript has identified an RNA stem-loop, termed ORF50-1, which is a m6A-modified 43-mer, essential for SND-1 binding, thought to occur in a secondary structure/ sequence-dependent manner. Generating in silico 3D structures of the ORF50-1 RNA in its native `N' and m6A-modified `M' form confirms that the presence of the m6A-modification has repercussions in the lower part of the stem-loop and predicts a different secondary structure(collab. Pasquale and Roeder). Due to the obvious structural differences anticipated, RNA-binding ligands have been identified using Small Molecule Microarrays (SMMS) (collab. Fullenkamp and Schneekloth). By investigating these ligands in biophysicalexperiments, we have verified RNA-binding and optimised cell-based assays to assess anti-viral properties. It is hoped these experiments will highlight the importance of A versus m6A within the lytic phase of KSHV's lifecycle.,},

  abstract = {Epigenomic maps identify gene regulatory elements by their chromatin state. However, prevailing short-read sequencing methods cannot effectively distinguish alleles, evaluate the interdependence of elements in a locus or capture single-molecule dynamics. Here, we apply targeted nanopore sequencing to profile chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on contiguous {\textasciitilde}100-kb DNA molecules that span loci relevant to development, immunity and imprinting. We detect promoters, enhancers, insulators and transcription factor footprints on single molecules based on exogenous GpC methylation. We infer relationships among dynamic elements within immune loci, and order successive remodeling events during T\,cell stimulation. Finally, we phase primary sequence and regulatory elements across the H19/IGF2 locus, uncovering primate-specific features. These include a segmental duplication that stabilizes the imprinting control region and a noncanonical enhancer that drives biallelic IGF2 expression in specific contexts. Our study advances emerging strategies for phasing gene regulatory landscapes and reveals a mechanism that overrides IGF2 imprinting in human cells.},

To explore the relationship between age-associated HSC decline and the epigenome, we examined global DNA methylation of HSCs during ontogeny in combination with functional analysis. Although the DNA methylome is generally stable during aging, site-specific alterations of DNA methylation occur at genomic regions associated with hematopoietic lineage potential and selectively target genes expressed in downstream progenitor and effector cells. We found that age-associated HSC decline, replicative limits, and DNA methylation are largely dependent on the proliferative history of HSCs, yet appear to be telomere-length independent. Physiological aging and experimentally enforced proliferation of HSCs both led to DNA hypermethylation of genes regulated by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. Our results provide evidence that epigenomic alterations of the DNA methylation landscape contribute to the functional decline of HSCs during aging.},

Blood lineage specification is currently thought to occur downstream of multipotent haematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Here we show that, in human, the first lineage restriction events occur within the CD19-CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD49f+CD90+ (49f+) HSC compartment to generate myelo-lymphoid committed cells with no erythroid differentiation capacity. At single-cell resolution, we observe a continuous but polarised organisation of the 49f+ compartment, where transcriptional programmes and lineage potential progressively change along a gradient of opposing cell surface expression of CLEC9A and CD34. CLEC9AhiCD34lo cells contain long-term repopulating multipotent HSCs with slow quiescence exit kinetics, whereas CLEC9AloCD34hi cells are restricted to myelo-lymphoid differentiation and display infrequent but durable repopulation capacity. We thus propose that human HSCs gradually transition to a discrete lymphoid-primed state, distinct from lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors, representing the earliest entry point into lymphoid commitment.},

Here, we show that a computational approach allows surprisingly accurate prediction of histone modifications solely from knowledge of transcription factor binding both at promoters and at potential distal regulatory elements. This accuracy significantly and substantially exceeds what could be achieved by using DNA sequence as an input feature. Remarkably, we show that transcription factor binding enables strikingly accurate predictions across different cell lines. Analysis of the relative importance of specific transcription factors as predictors of specific histone marks recapitulated known interactions between transcription factors and histone modifiers. Our results demonstrate that reported associations between histone marks and gene expression may be indirect effects caused by interactions between transcription factors and histone-modifying complexes.},

Moreover, this unique class of non-coding RNA has diverse roles in transcriptional regulation. Transcribed enhancers can be identified by a common signature of epigenetics marks by overlaying a series of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing datasets. A computational approach to filter non-enhancer elements and other classes of non-coding RNAs is essential to not cloud downstream analysis. Here we present a protocol that combines wet and dry bench methods to accurately identify transcribed enhancers genome-wide as well as an experimental procedure to validate these datasets.},

Two key tasks are typically carried out for motifs in the context of the analysis of genomic sequences. These are: identification in a set of DNA regions of over-represented motifs from a particular motif database, and de novo discovery of over-represented motifs. Here we describe existing methodology to perform these two tasks for motifs characterizing transcription factor binding. When applied to the output of ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo experiments, or to promoter regions of co-modulated genes, motif analysis techniques allow for the prediction of transcription factor binding events and enable identification of transcriptional regulators and co-regulators. The usefulness of motif analysis is further exemplified in this review by how motif discovery improves peak calling in ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo experiments and, when coupled with information on gene expression, allows insights into physical mechanisms of transcriptional modulation.},

By embedding data for epigenetic marks (H3K27ac), chromatin accessibility (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing [ATAC-seq]), and structural anchors (CCCTC-binding factor [CTCF]), we developed a highly predictive heteromorphic polymer (HiP-HoP) model, where the chromatin fiber varied along its length; combined with diffusing protein bridges and loop extrusion, this model predicted the 3D organization of genomic loci at a population and single-cell level. The model was validated at several gene loci, including the complex Pax6 gene, and was able to determine locus conformations across cell types with varying levels of transcriptional activity and explain different mechanisms of enhancer use. Minimal a priori knowledge of epigenetic marks is sufficient to recapitulate complex genomic loci in 3D and enable predictions of chromatin folding paths.},

During this process, gene expression patterns are programmed in a series of stages that bring about the restriction of cell potential, ultimately leading to the formation of specialized innate immune cells and mature lymphocytes that express antigen receptors. These events involve the regulation of both gene expression and DNA recombination, mainly through the control of chromatin accessibility. In this Review, we describe the epigenetic changes that mediate this complex differentiation process and try to understand the logic of the programming mechanism.},

We validate our model with Monte Carlo and hybrid Molecular Dynamics--Monte Carlo simulations and demonstrate that our theory recapitulates experimental chromatin conformation capture data. Our results support active loop extrusion as a mechanism for chromatin organization and provide an analytical description of chromatin organization that may be used to specifically modify chromatin contact probabilities.},

Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the genome have been reported and implicated in a number of different diseases, tissues and cell types, and are associated with gene expression levels. Therefore, identification of DMRs is one of the most critical and fundamental issues in dissecting the disease etiologies. Based on bisulfite conversion, advances in sequence- and array-based technologies have helped investigators study genome-wide DNA methylation. Many methods have been developed to detect DMRs, and they have revolutionized our understanding of DNA methylation and provided new insights into its role in diverse biological functions. According to data and region types, we discuss various methods in detecting DMRs, their utility and limitations comprehensively. We recommend using a few of the methods in the same data and region type to detect DMRs because they could be complementary to one another.},

Enhancer-promoter interactions could be relatively stable as cells transition from progenitor to differentiated states; alternatively, chromatin looping could be as dynamic as the gene expression from their loci. The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly renewing mammalian tissue. Proliferative cells in crypts of Lieberk{\"u}hn sustain a stream of differentiated cells~that are continually shed into the lumen. We apply chromosome conformation capture combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) and sequencing to measure enhancer-promoter interactions in progenitor and differentiated cells of the intestinal epithelium. Despite dynamic gene regulation across the differentiation axis, we find that enhancer-promoter interactions are relatively stable. Functionally, we find HNF4 transcription factors are required for chromatin looping at target genes. Depletion of HNF4 disrupts local chromatin looping, histone modifications, and target gene expression. This study provides insights into transcriptional regulatory mechanisms governing homeostasis in renewing tissues.},

To determine the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of tumorigenesis, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in tumor and adjacent normal tissues from LUSC patients. With the Infinium Methylation EPIC Array, {$>$}\,850,000 CpG sites, including {\textasciitilde}350,000 CpG sites for enhancer regions, were profiled, and the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) overlapping promoters (pDMRs) and enhancers (eDMRs) between tumor and normal tissues were identified. Dimension reduction based on DMR profiles revealed that eDMRs alone and not pDMRs alone can differentiate tumors from normal tissues with the equivalent performance of total DMRs. We observed a stronger negative correlation of LUSC-specific gene expression with methylation for enhancers than promoters. Target genes of eDMRs rather than pDMRs were found to be enriched for tumor-associated genes and pathways. Furthermore, DMR methylation associated with immune infiltration was more frequently observed among enhancers than promoters. Our results suggest that methylation of enhancer regions rather than promoters play more important roles in epigenetic regulation of tumorigenesis and immune infiltration in LUSC.},

Site-specific mutations were introduced in defined regions of DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 in CD34+ progenitor cells that were subsequently analyzed in short-term as well as long-term in vitro culture assays to assess self-renewal and differentiation capacities. Colony-forming unit (CFU) assays revealed enhanced self-renewal of TET2 mutated (TET2mut) cells, whereas ASXL1mut as well as DNMT3Amut cells did not reveal significant changes in short-term culture. Strikingly, enhanced colony formation could be detected in long-term culture experiments in all mutants, indicating increased self-renewal capacities. While we could also demonstrate preferential clonal expansion of distinct cell clones for all mutants, the clonal composition after long-term culture revealed a mutation-specific impact on HSPCs. Thus, by using primary umbilical cord blood cells, we were able to investigate epigenetic driver mutations without confounding factors like age or a complex mutational landscape, and our findings provide evidence for a direct impact of clonal hematopoiesis-associated mutations on self-renewal and clonal composition of human stem and progenitor cells.},

They orchestrate the continual production and turnover of the pulmonary extracellular matrix, the correct organization of which is vital for efficient gas exchange. The lung matrix also provides crucial structural support for various cells and exerts profound influences on their function. These interactions regulate normal airway and alveolar morphogenesis during fetal development, and regain prominence during repair responses following injury to these tissues. In addition to matrix formation, immune functions have also been ascribed to fibroblasts, including antigen presentation and the secretion of bioactive molecules. These roles highlight the versatility and indispensability of fibroblasts to the maintenance of normal lung physiology. Consequently, fibroblast dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disorders in which there is disproportionate extracellular matrix deposition (e.g., fibrotic lung diseases) or destruction (e.g., emphysematous and cystic lung disorders). In these settings, uncontrolled fibroblast activation and proliferation or, conversely, the loss of fibroblast number or function, contribute to the initiation and progression of abnormal lung repair. Substantial research efforts are being directed at identifying molecular targets and novel strategies to treat disorders characterized by pathological matrix remodeling.},

  abstract = {Cancer chromatin accessibility landscape                            The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides a high-quality resource of molecular data on a large variety of human cancers. Corces               et al.               used a recently modified assay to profile chromatin accessibility to determine the accessible chromatin landscape in 410 TCGA samples from 23 cancer types (see the Perspective by Taipale).

Although the 2\% of the human genome that encodes proteins has been extensively studied, much remains to be learned about the noncoding genome and gene regulation in cancer. Genes are turned on and off in the proper cell types and cell states by transcription factor (TF) proteins acting on DNA regulatory elements that are scattered over the vast noncoding genome and exert long-range influences. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a global consortium that aims to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer. TCGA has systematically collected DNA mutation, methylation, RNA expression, and other comprehensive datasets from primary human cancer tissue. TCGA has served as an invaluable resource for the identification of genomic aberrations, altered transcriptional networks, and cancer subtypes. Nonetheless, the gene regulatory landscapes of these tumors have largely been inferred through indirect means.                                         RATIONALE               A hallmark of active DNA regulatory elements is chromatin accessibility. Eukaryotic genomes are compacted in chromatin, a complex of DNA and proteins, and only the active regulatory elements are accessible by the cell's machinery such as TFs. The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) quantifies DNA accessibility through the use of transposase enzymes that insert sequencing adapters at these accessible chromatin sites. ATAC-seq enables the genome-wide profiling of TF binding events that orchestrate gene expression programs and give a cell its identity.                                         RESULTS                                We generated high-quality ATAC-seq data in 410 tumor samples from TCGA, identifying diverse regulatory landscapes across 23 cancer types. These chromatin accessibility profiles identify cancer- and tissue-specific DNA regulatory elements that enable classification of tumor subtypes with newly recognized prognostic importance. We identify distinct TF activities in cancer based on differences in the inferred patterns of TF-DNA interaction and gene expression. Genome-wide correlation of gene expression and chromatin accessibility predicts tens of thousands of putative interactions between distal regulatory elements and gene promoters, including key oncogenes and targets in cancer immunotherapy, such as                 MYC                 ,                 SRC                 ,                 BCL2                 , and                 PDL1                 . Moreover, these regulatory interactions inform known genetic risk loci linked to cancer predisposition, nominating biochemical mechanisms and target genes for many cancer-linked genetic variants. Lastly, integration with mutation profiling by whole-genome sequencing identifies cancer-relevant noncoding mutations that are associated with altered gene expression. A single-base mutation located 12 kilobases upstream of the                 FGD4                 gene, a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, generates a putative de novo binding site for an NKX TF and is associated with an increase in chromatin accessibility and a concomitant increase in                 FGD4                 gene expression.                                                        CONCLUSION               The accessible genome of primary human cancers provides a wealth of information on the susceptibility, mechanisms, prognosis, and potential therapeutic strategies of diverse cancer types. Prediction of interactions between DNA regulatory elements and gene promoters sets the stage for future integrative gene regulatory network analyses.

Corces               et al.               used a recently modified assay to profile chromatin accessibility to determine the accessible chromatin landscape in 410 TCGA samples from 23 cancer types (see the Perspective by Taipale).

Although the 2\% of the human genome that encodes proteins has been extensively studied, much remains to be learned about the noncoding genome and gene regulation in cancer. Genes are turned on and off in the proper cell types and cell states by transcription factor (TF) proteins acting on DNA regulatory elements that are scattered over the vast noncoding genome and exert long-range influences. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a global consortium that aims to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer. TCGA has systematically collected DNA mutation, methylation, RNA expression, and other comprehensive datasets from primary human cancer tissue. TCGA has served as an invaluable resource for the identification of genomic aberrations, altered transcriptional networks, and cancer subtypes. Nonetheless, the gene regulatory landscapes of these tumors have largely been inferred through indirect means.

We performed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) in 41 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking known elongation regulators, including RNA processing factors, transcription elongation factors, chromatin modifiers, and remodelers. We found that the opposing effects of these factors balance transcription elongation and antisense transcription. Different sets of factors tightly regulate Pol II progression across gene bodies so that Pol II density peaks at key points of RNA processing. These regulators control where Pol II pauses with each obscuring large numbers of potential pause sites that are primarily determined by DNA sequence and shape. Antisense transcription varies highly across the regulatory landscapes analyzed, but antisense transcription in itself does not affect sense transcription at the same locus. Our findings collectively show that a diverse array of factors regulate transcription elongation by precisely balancing Pol II activity.}

  abstract = {Hypermethylation of CpG islands (CGI) is a common feature of cancer cells and predominantly affects Polycomb-associated genomic regions. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms leading to DNA hypermethylation in human cancer could help identify chemoprevention strategies. Here, we evaluated the role of Polycomb complexes and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) oxidases in protecting CGIs from DNA methylation and observed that four genes coding for components of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) are downregulated in tumors. Inactivation of RYBP, a key activator of variant PRC1 complexes, in combination with all three 5mC oxidases (TET proteins) in nontumorigenic bronchial epithelial cells led to widespread hypermethylation of Polycomb-marked CGIs affecting almost 4,000 target genes, which closely resembled the DNA hypermethylation landscape observed in human squamous cell lung tumors. The RYBP- and TET-deficient cells showed methylation-associated aberrant regulation of cancer-relevant pathways, including defects in the Hippo tumor suppressor network. Notably, the quadruple knockout cells acquired a transformed phenotype, including anchorage-independent growth and formation of squamous cell carcinomas in mice. This work provides a mechanism promoting hypermethylation of CGIs and shows that such hypermethylation can lead to cell transformation. The breakdown of a two-pronged protection mechanism can be a route towards genome-wide hypermethylation of CGIs in tumors.},

  abstract = {Hypermethylation of CpG islands (CGI) is a common feature of cancer cells and predominantly affects Polycomb-associated genomic regions. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms leading to DNA hypermethylation in human cancer could help identify chemoprevention strategies. Here, we evaluated the role of Polycomb complexes and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) oxidases in protecting CGIs from DNA methylation and observed that four genes coding for components of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) are downregulated in tumors. Inactivation of RYBP, a key activator of variant PRC1 complexes, in combination with all three 5mC oxidases (TET proteins) in nontumorigenic bronchial epithelial cells led to widespread hypermethylation of Polycomb-marked CGIs affecting almost 4,000 target genes, which closely resembled the DNA hypermethylation landscape observed in human squamous cell lung tumors. The RYBP- and TET-deficient cells showed methylation-associated aberrant regulation of cancer-relevant pathways, including defects in the Hippo tumor suppressor network. Notably, the quadruple knockout cells acquired a transformed phenotype, including anchorage-independent growth and formation of squamous cell carcinomas in mice. This work provides a mechanism promoting hypermethylation of CGIs and shows that such hypermethylation can lead to cell transformation. The breakdown of a two-pronged protection mechanism can be a route towards genome-wide hypermethylation of CGIs in tumors.},

We have re-designed the Capture-C method producing a new approach, called next generation (NG) Capture-C. This produces unprecedented levels of sensitivity and reproducibility and can be used to analyse many genetic loci and samples simultaneously. Importantly, high-resolution data can be produced on as few as 100,000 cells and SNPs can be used to generate allele specific tracks. The method is straightforward to perform and should therefore greatly facilitate the task of linking SNPs identified by genome wide association studies with the genes they influence. The complete and detailed protocol presented here, with new publicly available tools for library design and data analysis, will allow most laboratories to analyse chromatin conformation at levels of sensitivity and throughput that were previously impossible.},

However, the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms driving the crosstalk between nuclear architecture and (epi)genomic information is still lacking. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a powerful model organism to address these questions owing to its compact genome for which we have a rich collection of microscopy, chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and ChIP-seq experiments. Using polymer modelling, we investigate the roles of nucleolus formation and epigenomics-driven interactions in shaping the 3D genome of A. thaliana. By validation of several predictions with published data, we demonstrate that self-attracting nucleolar organizing regions and repulsive constitutive heterochromatin are major mechanisms to regulate the organization of chromosomes. Simulations also suggest that interphase chromosomes maintain a partial structural memory of the V-shapes, typical of (sub)metacentric chromosomes in anaphase. Additionally, self-attraction between facultative heterochromatin regions facilitates the formation of Polycomb bodies hosting H3K27me3-enriched gene-clusters. Since nucleolus and heterochromatin are highly-conserved in eukaryotic cells, our findings pave the way for a comprehensive characterization of the generic principles that are likely to shape and regulate the 3D genome in many species.},

We apply TADdyn on in situ Hi-C time-course experiments studying the reprogramming of murine B cells to pluripotent cells, and characterize the structural rearrangements that take place upon changes in the transcriptional state of 21 genomic loci of diverse expression dynamics. By measuring various structural and dynamical properties, we find that during gene activation, the transcription starting site contacts with open and active regions in 3D chromatin domains. We propose that these 3D hubs of open and active chromatin may constitute a general feature to trigger and maintain gene transcription.},

  abstract = {Single cells displaying many characteristics in common with smooth muscle are now being identified in many organs. Although their origin remains elusive, they are nonetheless known to play a major role in fibroproliferative diseases and stromal reactions by virtue of their contractile properties. We have investigated the contractile properties and expression of smooth muscle-associated proteins in such a cell line derived from human foetal lung (IMR-90). For almost two decades, these cells have served as model fibroblasts in a wide variety of studies. And yet, IMR-90 cells manifest many features characteristic of differentiated smooth muscle cells: they exhibit the same elongated, slender form and the strikingly regular, longitudinal alignment of their actin-attachment sites, which are indispensable for coordinated contraction. Moreover, these adhaerens junctions also contain metavinculin, the smooth muscle analogue of vinculin, the stable expression of which has not previously been demonstrated in cultured cells. Since sm 22, as well as the smooth muscle-associated {$\alpha$}-actin isoform and calponin are also expressed, IMR-90 cells must now be classified as myofibroblasts. When cultivated on a rubbery silicon surface, IMR-90 cells respond to stimulation with a rate of contraction which is considerably faster than that exhibited by fibroblasts derived from other established lines. Taken together, the regular longitudinal orientation of the adhaerens junctions, the stable expression of metavinculin, and the rapid speed of shortening in IMR-90 cells suggest, by implication, that the periodicity of actin attachment sites is a fundamental determinant of contractile efficiency in smooth muscle cells; this spacing may be mediated by metavinculin. {\copyright} 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Aberrant DNA methylation is also associated with neurological diseases, immunological diseases, atherosclerosis, and osteoporosis. In this review, I discuss DNA hypermethylation in disease and its interrelationships with normal development as well as proposed mechanisms for the origin of and pathogenic consequences of disease-associated hypermethylation. Disease-linked DNA hypermethylation can help drive oncogenesis partly by its effects on cancer stem cells and by the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP); atherosclerosis by disease-related cell transdifferentiation; autoimmune and neurological diseases through abnormal perturbations of cell memory; and diverse age-associated diseases by age-related accumulation of epigenetic alterations.},

Loss of DNA methylation within partially methylated domains (PMDs), late-replicating regions of the genome attached to the nuclear lamina, advances with age in normal tissues, and is further exacerbated in cancer. We present here experimental evidence that this DNA hypomethylation is directly driven by proliferation-associated DNA replication. Within PMDs, loss of DNA methylation at low-density CpGs in A:T-rich immediate context (PMD solo-WCGWs) tracks cumulative population doublings in primary cell culture. Cell cycle deceleration results in a proportional decrease in the rate of DNA hypomethylation. Blocking DNA replication via Mitomycin C treatment halts methylation loss. Loss of methylation continues unabated after TERT immortalization until finally reaching a severely hypomethylated equilibrium. Ambient oxygen culture conditions increases the rate of methylation loss compared to low-oxygen conditions, suggesting that some methylation loss may occur during unscheduled, oxidative damage repair-associated DNA synthesis. Finally, we present and validate a model to estimate the relative cumulative replicative histories of human cells, which we call ``RepliTali'' (Replication Times Accumulated in Lifetime)., DNA methylation loss has been observed in aging tissues and cancers for decades. Researchers from Van Andel Institute have now provided experimental evidence that this process is directly driven by cell division.},

  abstract = {Clonal expansions driven by somatic mutations become pervasive across human tissues with age, including in the haematopoietic system, where the phenomenon is termed clonal haematopoiesis1--4. The understanding of how and when clonal haematopoiesis develops, the factors that govern its behaviour, how it interacts with ageing and how these variables relate to malignant progression remains limited5,6. Here we track 697 clonal haematopoiesis clones from 385 individuals 55 years of age or older over a median of 13 years. We find that 92.4\% of clones expanded at a stable exponential rate over the study period, with different mutations driving substantially different growth rates, ranging from 5\% (DNMT3A and TP53) to more than 50\% per year (SRSF2P95H). Growth rates of clones with the same mutation differed by approximately {\textpm}5\% per year, proportionately affecting slow drivers more substantially. By combining our time-series data with phylogenetic analysis of 1,731 whole-genome sequences of haematopoietic colonies from 7 individuals from an older age group, we reveal distinct patterns of lifelong clonal behaviour. DNMT3A-mutant clones preferentially expanded early in life and displayed slower growth in old age, in the context of an increasingly competitive oligoclonal landscape. By contrast, splicing gene mutations drove expansion only later in life, whereas TET2-mutant clones emerged across all ages. Finally, we show that mutations driving faster clonal growth carry a higher risk of malignant progression. Our findings characterize the lifelong natural history of clonal haematopoiesis and give fundamental insights into the interactions between somatic mutation, ageing and clonal selection.},

We used a meta-epigenomic approach that combines DNA methylation profiles across many small pools of cells and performed single-cell methylome sequencing to assess cell-to-cell heterogeneity. The resulting dataset identified characteristic differences between HSCs derived from fetal liver, cord blood, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. We~also observed lineage-specific DNA methylation between myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, characterized immature multi-lymphoid progenitors, and detected progressive DNA methylation differences in maturing megakaryocytes. We linked these patterns to gene expression, histone modifications, and~chromatin accessibility, and we used machine learning to derive a model of human hematopoietic differentiation directly from DNA methylation data. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and provide a framework for studying blood-linked diseases.},

Both the distribution of these factors and the contacts between different genomic locations of the DNA can now be measured on a genome-wide scale. This has advanced the development of models aimed at predicting the conformation of DNA given only the locations of bound factors---the chromatin folding problem. Here we present a maximum-entropy model that is able to predict a contact map representation of structure given a sequence of bound factors. Non-local effects due to the sequence neighborhood around contacting sites are found to be important for making accurate predictions. Lastly, we show that the model can be used to infer a sequence of bound factors given only a measurement of structure. This opens up the possibility for efficiently predicting sequence regions that may play a role in generating cell-type specific structural differences.},

Fluorescence microscopy can be used to find out where the fluorescent probe is bound to the chromosomes. FISH is often used for finding specific features in DNA for use in genetic counseling, medicine, and species identification. FISH can also be used to detect and localize specific RNA targets (mRNA, lncRNA and miRNA) in cells, circulating tumor cells, and tissue samples. In this context, it can help define the spatial-temporal patterns of gene expression within cells and tissues.},

The histone H3-H4 modification landscape is restored by parental histone recycling and modification of new histones. How DNA replication impacts on histone H2A-H2B is currently unknown. Here, we measure H2A-H2B modifications and H2A.Z during DNA replication and across the cell cycle using quantitative genomics. We show that H2AK119ub1, H2BK120ub1, and H2A.Z are recycled accurately during DNA replication. Modified H2A-H2B are segregated symmetrically to daughter strands via POLA1 on the lagging strand, but independent of H3-H4 recycling. Post-replication, H2A-H2B modification and variant landscapes are quickly restored, and H2AK119ub1 guides accurate restoration of H3K27me3. This work reveals epigenetic transmission of parental H2A-H2B during DNA replication and identifies cross talk between H3-H4 and H2A-H2B modifications in epigenome propagation. We propose that rapid short-term memory of recycled H2A-H2B modifications facilitates restoration of stable H3-H4 chromatin states.},

We compared the structure and function of the CXXC domains in the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 and the methylcytosine dioxygenase Tet1. Sequence alignment showed that both CXXC domains have a very similar framework but differ in the central tip region. Based on the known structure of a similar MLL1 domain we developed homology models and designed expression constructs for the isolated CXXC domains of Dnmt1 and Tet1 accordingly. We show that the CXXC domain of Tet1 has no DNA binding activity and is dispensable for catalytic activity in vivo. In contrast, the CXXC domain of Dnmt1 selectively binds DNA substrates containing unmethylated CpG sites. Surprisingly, a Dnmt1 mutant construct lacking the CXXC domain formed covalent complexes with cytosine bases both in vitro and in vivo and rescued DNA methylation patterns in dnmt1{$^-$}/{$^-$} embryonic stem cells (ESCs) just as efficiently as wild type Dnmt1. Interestingly, neither wild type nor {$\Delta$}CXXC Dnmt1 re-methylated imprinted CpG sites of the H19a promoter in dnmt1{$^-$}/{$^-$} ESCs, arguing against a role of the CXXC domain in restraining Dnmt1 methyltransferase activity on unmethylated CpG sites.},

HT-ChIP was applied to define the dynamics of DNA binding by 25 TFs and 4 chromatin marks at 4 time-points following pathogen stimulus of dendritic cells. Analyzing over 180,000 TF-DNA interactions we find that TFs vary substantially in their temporal binding landscapes. This data suggests a model for transcription regulation whereby TF networks are hierarchically organized into cell differentiation factors, factors that bind targets prior to stimulus to prime them for induction, and factors that regulate specific gene programs. Overlaying HT-ChIP data on gene-expression dynamics shows that many TF-DNA interactions are established prior to the stimuli, predominantly at immediate-early genes, and identified specific TF ensembles that coordinately regulate gene-induction.},

Corroborating these results with genomic analyses, we find clear human promoter TFBS orientation biases and similar TFBS orientation and order transcriptional effects in an MPRA that tested 164,307 liver candidate regulatory elements. Additionally, by adding TFBS orientation to a model that predicts expression from sequence we improve performance by 7.7\%.

This model predicts actual physical distances and to what extent chromosomal contacts vary between cells. It also identifies interactions within single TADs that stabilize boundaries between TADs and allows us to identify and genetically validate key structural elements within TADs. Combining the model's predictions with high-resolution DNA FISH and quantitative RNA FISH for TADs within the X-inactivation center (Xic), we dissect the relationship between transcription and spatial proximity to cis-regulatory elements. We demonstrate that contacts between potential regulatory elements occur in the context of fluctuating structures rather than stable loops and propose that such fluctuations may contribute to asymmetric expression in the Xic during X inactivation.},

  abstract = {We performed cytosine methylation sequencing on genetically diverse patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and found leukemic DNA methylation patterning is primarily driven by nonpromoter regulatory elements and CpG shores. Enhancers displayed stronger differential methylation than promoters, consisting predominantly of hypomethylation. AMLs with dominant hypermethylation featured greater epigenetic disruption of promoters, whereas those with dominant hypomethylation displayed greater disruption of distal and intronic regions. Mutations in IDH and DNMT3A had opposing and mutually exclusive effects on the epigenome. Notably, co-occurrence of both mutations resulted in epigenetic antagonism, with most CpGs affected by either mutation alone no longer affected in double-mutant AMLs. Importantly, this epigenetic antagonism precedes malignant transformation and can be observed in preleukemic LSK cells from Idh2R140Q or Dnmt3aR882H single-mutant and Idh2R140Q/Dnmt3aR882H double-mutant mice. Notably, IDH/DNMT3A double-mutant AMLs manifested upregulation of a RAS signaling signature and displayed unique sensitivity to MEK inhibition ex vivo as compared with AMLs with either single mutation.Significance: AML is biologically heterogeneous with subtypes characterized by specific genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. Comprehensive DNA methylation profiling revealed that differential methylation of nonpromoter regulatory elements is a driver of epigenetic identity, that gene mutations can be context-dependent, and that co-occurrence of mutations in epigenetic modifiers can result in epigenetic antagonism.

Chromosome conformation capture (3C) methods effectively capture large-scale three-dimensional (3D) genome structure but struggle to achieve the depth necessary to resolve fine-scale E-P interactions. Here, we develop Region Capture Micro-C (RCMC) by combining micrococcal nuclease (MNase)-based 3C with a tiling region-capture approach and generate the deepest 3D genome maps reported with only modest sequencing. By applying RCMC in mouse embryonic stem cells and reaching the genome-wide equivalent of {\textasciitilde}317 billion unique contacts, RCMC reveals previously unresolvable patterns of highly nested and focal 3D interactions, which we term microcompartments. Microcompartments frequently connect enhancers and promoters, and although loss of loop extrusion and inhibition of transcription disrupts some microcompartments, most are largely unaffected. We therefore propose that many E-P interactions form through a compartmentalization mechanism, which may partially explain why acute cohesin depletion only modestly affects global gene expression.},

  abstract = {The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) provides a simple and scalable way to detect the unique chromatin landscape associated with a cell type and how it may be altered by perturbation or disease. ATAC-seq requires a relatively small number of input cells and does not require a priori knowledge of the epigenetic marks or transcription factors governing the dynamics of the system. Here we describe an updated and optimized protocol for ATAC-seq, called Omni-ATAC, that is applicable across a broad range of cell and tissue types. The ATAC-seq workflow has five main steps: sample preparation, transposition, library preparation, sequencing and data analysis. This protocol details the steps to generate and sequence ATAC-seq libraries, with recommendations for sample preparation and downstream bioinformatic analysis. ATAC-seq libraries for roughly 12 samples can be generated in 10 h by someone familiar with basic molecular biology, and downstream sequencing analysis can be implemented using benchmarked pipelines by someone with basic bioinformatics skills and with access to a high-performance computing environment.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors bind regulatory DNA sequences in a combinatorial manner to modulate gene expression. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn the cis-regulatory grammars encoded in regulatory DNA sequences associated with transcription factor binding and chromatin accessibility. Several feature attribution methods have been developed for estimating the predictive importance of individual features (nucleotides or motifs) in any input DNA sequence to its associated output prediction from a DNN model. However, these methods do not reveal higher-order feature interactions encoded by the models.We present a new method called Deep Feature Interaction Maps (DFIM) to efficiently estimate interactions between all pairs of features in any input DNA sequence. DFIM accurately identifies ground truth motif interactions embedded in simulated regulatory DNA sequences. DFIM identifies synergistic interactions between GATA1 and TAL1 motifs from in~vivo TF binding models. DFIM reveals epistatic interactions involving nucleotides flanking the core motif of the Cbf1 TF in yeast from in~vitro TF binding models. We also apply DFIM to regulatory sequence models of in~vivo chromatin accessibility to reveal interactions between regulatory genetic variants and proximal motifs of target TFs as validated by TF binding quantitative trait loci. Our approach makes significant strides in improving the interpretability of deep learning models for genomics.Code is available at: https://github.com/kundajelab/dfim.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here we use nucleosome occupancy and methylation sequencing method to analyze both the genome-wide chromatin accessibility and DNA methylome at a series of crucial time points during fetal germ cell development in both human and mouse. We find 116 887 and 137 557 nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) in human and mouse FGCs, covering a large set of germline-specific and highly dynamic regulatory genomic elements, such as enhancers. Moreover, we find that the distal NDRs are enriched specifically for binding motifs of the pluripotency and germ cell master regulators such as NANOG, SOX17, AP2{$\gamma$} and OCT4 in human FGCs, indicating the existence of a delicate regulatory balance between pluripotency-related genes and germ cell-specific genes in human FGCs, and the functional significance of these genes for germ cell development in vivo. Our work offers a comprehensive and high-resolution roadmap for dissecting chromatin state transition dynamics during the epigenomic reprogramming of human and mouse FGCs.},

  abstract = {Nuclear compartments are prominent features of 3D chromatin organization, but sequencing depth limitations have impeded investigation at ultra fine-scale. CTCF loops are generally studied at a finer scale, but the impact of looping on proximal interactions remains enigmatic. Here, we critically examine nuclear compartments and CTCF loop-proximal interactions using a combination of in situ Hi-C at unparalleled depth, algorithm development, and biophysical modeling. Producing a large Hi-C map with 33 billion contacts in conjunction with an algorithm for performing principal component analysis on sparse, super massive matrices~(POSSUMM), we resolve compartments to 500\,bp. Our results demonstrate that essentially all active promoters and distal enhancers localize in the A compartment, even when flanking sequences do not. Furthermore, we find that the TSS and TTS of paused genes are often segregated into separate compartments. We then identify diffuse interactions that radiate from CTCF loop anchors, which correlate with strong enhancer-promoter interactions and proximal transcription. We also find that these diffuse interactions depend on CTCF's RNA binding domains. In this work, we demonstrate features of fine-scale chromatin organization consistent with a revised model in which compartments are more precise than commonly thought while CTCF loops are more protracted.},

Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) has become a powerful, routinely applied tool to analyze the genome architecture specifically on the micro-scale. A plethora of well characterized FISH probes (e.g., DNA, PNA) are commercially available which are specific for gene targets, centromeres, telomeres, whole chromosome territories and sub-chromosomal domains. Together with standardized protocols these probes are delivered as ready-to-use kits for fluorescence microscopy of 3D conserved cell nuclei in biological research as well as for clinical diagnostics. In this article, some developments of FISH are reviewed and characteristic steps of the procedure are described. Examples are presented. With the development of super-resolution microscopy for nano-scale investigations, requirements for nano-FISH probes promoted the development of oligonucleotide based FISH techniques as for instance COMBinatorial Oligo FISH (COMBO-FISH). The development of COMBO-FISH is also reviewed especially with respect to low temperature approaches that allow the combination of COMBO-FISH with other epigenetic techniques like immunostaining with specific antibodies. Examples are presented for analyses by super-resolution single molecule localization microscopy.},

Regulation of transcription is a fundamental cellular process where the mechanisms involved in initiation have been studied extensively, but those involved in arresting the process are poorly understood. Modeling of the potential roles of RNA in transcriptional control suggested a non-equilibrium feedback control mechanism where low levels of RNA promote condensates formed by electrostatic interactions whereas relatively high levels promote dissolution of these condensates. Evidence from in~vitro and in~vivo experiments support a model where RNAs produced during early steps in transcription initiation stimulate condensate formation, whereas the burst of RNAs produced during elongation stimulate condensate dissolution. We propose that transcriptional regulation incorporates a feedback mechanism whereby transcribed RNAs initially stimulate but then ultimately arrest the process.},

  abstract = {It remains unclear why acute depletion of CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) and cohesin only marginally affects expression of most genes despite substantially perturbing three-dimensional (3D) genome folding at the level of domains and structural loops. To address this conundrum, we used high-resolution Micro-C and nascent transcript profiling in mouse embryonic stem cells. We find that enhancer--promoter (E--P) interactions are largely insensitive to acute (3-h) depletion of CTCF, cohesin or WAPL. YY1 has been proposed as a structural regulator of E--P loops, but acute YY1 depletion also had minimal effects on E--P loops, transcription and 3D genome folding. Strikingly, live-cell, single-molecule imaging revealed that cohesin depletion reduced transcription factor (TF) binding to chromatin. Thus, although CTCF, cohesin, WAPL or YY1 is not required for the short-term maintenance of most E--P interactions and gene expression, our results suggest that cohesin may facilitate TFs to search for and bind their targets more efficiently.},

  abstract = {Whereas folding of genomes at the large scale of epigenomic compartments and topologically associating domains is now relatively well understood, how chromatin is folded at finer scales remains largely unexplored in mammals. Here, we overcome some limitations of conventional 3C-based methods by using high-resolution Micro-C to probe links between 3D genome organization and transcriptional regulation in mouse stem cells. Combinatorial binding of transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin modifiers spatially segregates TAD regions into various finer-scale structures with distinct regulatory features including stripes, dots, and domains linking promoters-to-promoters (P-P) or enhancers-to-promoters (E-P), and bundle contacts between Polycomb regions. E-P stripes extending from the edge of domains predominantly link co-expressed loci, often in the absence of CTCF and cohesin occupancy. Acute inhibition of transcription disrupts these gene-related folding features without altering higher-order chromatin structures. Our study uncovers previously obscured finer-scale genome organization, establishing functional links between chromatin folding and gene regulation., Hsieh et al. describe chromatin folding at single-nucleosome resolution in mammalian cells using Micro-C, an enhanced chromosome conformation capture method. Micro-C uncovers genome-wide, fine-scale chromatin organizational features shaped by gene activity, transcriptional regulation, and gene silencing.,},

Loss-of-function approaches in B cell precursors show that IKAROS assembles interactions across megabase distances in preparation for lymphoid development. Interactions emanating from IKAROS-bound enhancers override CTCF-imposed boundaries to assemble lineage-specific regulatory units built on a backbone of smaller invariant topological domains. Gain of function in epithelial cells confirms IKAROS' ability to reconfigure chromatin architecture at multiple scales. Although the compaction of the Ig{$\kappa$} locus required for genome editing represents a function of IKAROS unique to lymphocytes, the more general function to preconfigure the genome to support lineage-specific gene expression and suppress activation of extra-lineage genes provides a paradigm for lineage restriction.},

  abstract = {A major drawback for genetic studies as well as long-term genotype-phenotype correlation studies in cancer is lack of representative human cell lines providing a continuous source of basic biomolecules and a system to carry out various experimental investigations. This can be overcome to some extent by establishing lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) by infecting peripheral blood lymphocytes with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) which is known to immortalize human resting B cells in vitro giving rise to actively proliferating B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. The present study involves preparation and characterization of LCLs generated from patients with multiple primary neoplasms (MPN) of upper aero-digestive tract (UADT). Thirty seven LCLs were established from UADT MPN patients and healthy age, sex and habit matched controls using EBV crude stock. Characterization was done with respect to expression of CD-19 (Pan B-cell marker), CD3 (T cell specific marker), CD56 (NK-cell specific marker), cell morphology, ploidy analysis, genotype and gene expression comparison with the parent lymphocytes. LCLs showed rosette morphology with doubling time of approximately 24 h. Ploidy analysis showed diploid DNA content which was maintained for at least 30 population doublings. When compared with parent lymphocytes there appeared no change at genetic and gene expression level. Our results show that lymphoblastoid cell lines are a good surrogate of isolated lymphocytes bearing their close resemblance at genetic and phenotypic level to parent lymphocytes and are a valuable resource for understanding genotype-phenotype interactions.},

This provides a detailed description of both intra- and inter-chromosomal arrangements. Chromosomal intermingling is an important driver for radiation-induced DNA mis-repair. Which is a key biological endpoint of relevance to the fields of cancer therapy (radiotherapy), public health (biodosimetry) and space travel. For the first time, we leverage these methods of inferring genome organisation and couple them to nano-dosimetric radiation track structure modelling to predict quantities and distribution of DNA damage within cell-type specific geometries. These nano-dosimetric simulations are highly dependent on geometry and are benefited from the inclusion of experimentally driven chromosome conformations. We show how the changes in Hi-C contract maps impact the inferred geometries resulting in significant differences in chromosomal intermingling. We demonstrate how these differences propagate through to significant changes in the distribution of DNA damage throughout the cell nucleus, suggesting implications for DNA repair fidelity and subsequent cell fate. We suggest that differences in the geometric clustering for the chromosomes between the cell-types are a plausible factor leading to changes in cellular radiosensitivity. Furthermore, we investigate changes in cell shape, such as flattening, and show that this greatly impacts the distribution of DNA damage. This should be considered when comparing in vitro results to in vivo systems. The effect may be especially important when attempting to translate radiosensitivity measurements at the experimental in vitro level to the patient or human level.},

  abstract = {Candidate enhancers can be identified on the basis of chromatin modifications, the binding of chromatin modifiers and transcription factors and cofactors, or chromatin accessibility. However, validating such candidates as bona fide enhancers requires functional characterization, typically achieved through reporter assays that test whether a sequence can increase expression of a transcriptional reporter via a minimal promoter. A longstanding concern is that reporter assays are mainly implemented on episomes, which are thought to lack physiological chromatin. However, the magnitude and determinants of differences in cis-regulation for regulatory sequences residing in episomes versus chromosomes remain almost completely unknown. To address this systematically, we developed and applied a novel lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assay (lentiMPRA) to directly compare the functional activities of 2236 candidate liver enhancers in an episomal versus a chromosomally integrated context. We find that the activities of chromosomally integrated sequences are substantially different from the activities of the identical sequences assayed on episomes, and furthermore are correlated with different subsets of ENCODE annotations. The results of chromosomally based reporter assays are also more reproducible and more strongly predictable by both ENCODE annotations and sequence-based models. With a linear model that combines chromatin annotations and sequence information, we achieve a Pearson's R2 of 0.362 for predicting the results of chromosomally integrated reporter assays. This level of prediction is better than with either chromatin annotations or sequence information alone and also outperforms predictive models of episomal assays. Our results have broad implications for how cis-regulatory elements are identified, prioritized and functionally validated.},

  abstract = {For the past 25 years, it has been known that alterations in DNA methylation (DNAm) occur in cancer, including hypomethylation of oncogenes and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. However, most studies of cancer methylation have assumed that functionally important DNAm will occur in promoters, and that most DNAm changes in cancer occur in CpG islands. Here we show that most methylation alterations in colon cancer occur not in promoters, and also not in CpG islands, but in sequences up to 2 kb distant, which we term 'CpG island shores'. CpG island shore methylation was strongly related to gene expression, and it was highly conserved in mouse, discriminating tissue types regardless of species of origin. There was a notable overlap (45-65\%) of the locations of colon cancer-related methylation changes with those that distinguished normal tissues, with hypermethylation enriched closer to the associated CpG islands, and hypomethylation enriched further from the associated CpG island and resembling that of noncolon normal tissues. Thus, methylation changes in cancer are at sites that vary normally in tissue differentiation, consistent with the epigenetic progenitor model of cancer, which proposes that epigenetic alterations affecting tissue-specific differentiation are the predominant mechanism by which epigenetic changes cause cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of hematologic cancers increases with age. These cancers are associated with recurrent somatic mutations in specific genes. We hypothesized that such mutations would be detectable in the blood of some persons who are not known to have hematologic disorders. METHODS: We analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from DNA in the peripheral-blood cells of 17,182 persons who were unselected for hematologic phenotypes. We looked for somatic mutations by identifying previously characterized single-nucleotide variants and small insertions or deletions in 160 genes that are recurrently mutated in hematologic cancers. The presence of mutations was analyzed for an association with hematologic phenotypes, survival, and cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Detectable somatic mutations were rare in persons younger than 40 years of age but rose appreciably in frequency with age. Among persons 70 to 79 years of age, 80 to 89 years of age, and 90 to 108 years of age, these clonal mutations were observed in 9.5\% (219 of 2300 persons), 11.7\% (37 of 317), and 18.4\% (19 of 103), respectively. The majority of the variants occurred in three genes: DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1. The presence of a somatic mutation was associated with an increase in the risk of hematologic cancer (hazard ratio, 11.1; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 32.6), an increase in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 1.8), and increases in the risks of incident coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 3.4) and ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95\% CI, 1.4 to 4.8). CONCLUSIONS: Age-related clonal hematopoiesis is a common condition that is associated with increases in the risk of hematologic cancer and in all-cause mortality, with the latter possibly due to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

Various theories of cancer origins have emerged, including the suggestion that it is `bad luck': the inevitable consequence of random mutations in proliferating stem cells. In this Review, we discuss the principal theories of cancer origins and the relative importance of the factors that underpin them. The body of available evidence suggests that developing and ageing tissues `walk a tightrope', retaining adequate levels of cell plasticity to generate and maintain tissues while avoiding overstepping into transformation. Rather than viewing cancer as `bad luck', understanding the complex choreography of cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors that characterize transformation holds promise to discover effective new ways to prevent, detect and stop cancer before it becomes incurable.},

Our ability to obtain complete methylomes has transformed our appreciation of the role of DNA methylation in epigenetic processes.DNA methylation in the bodies of genes has long been ignored but might be involved in differential promoter usage and also in transcription elongation and alternative splicing. Repetitive DNA from intragenomic parasites is heavily methylated, which allows transcription of the host gene at the same time as preventing transcription initiation of the repetitive DNA.Methylation of control regions outside of the transcription start sites --- such as enhancers and insulators --- is increasingly being recognized as being functionally important.Demethylation of DNA is now accepted as being essential for embryonic development and seems to occur mainly in regions of DNA that are not CpG islands; thus, methylation patterns are increasingly being realized as being far more dynamic than previously recognized.},

On standard 2D pathologic examination, fibroblast foci are considered small, distinct lesions, although they have been proposed to form a highly interconnected reticulum as the leading edge of a "wave" of fibrosis. Here, we characterized fibroblast focus morphology and interrelationships in 3D using an integrated micro-CT and histological methodology. In 3D, fibroblast foci were morphologically complex structures, with large variations in shape and volume (range, 1.3 {\texttimes} 104 to 9.9 {\texttimes} 107 {$\mu$}m3). Within each tissue sample numerous multiform foci were present, ranging from a minimum of 0.9 per mm3 of lung tissue to a maximum of 11.1 per mm3 of lung tissue. Each focus was an independent structure, and no interconnections were observed. Together, our data indicate that in 3D fibroblast foci form a constellation of heterogeneous structures with large variations in shape and volume, suggesting previously unrecognized plasticity. No evidence of interconnectivity was identified, consistent with the concept that foci represent discrete sites of lung injury and repair.},

Their combinatorial binding does not require any specific motif orientation or spacing, suggesting an alternative mode of enhancer function whereby cooperative activity occurs with extensive motif flexibility. A~fraction of enhancers co-occupied by cardiogenic TFs had unexpected activity in the neighboring visceral mesoderm but could be rendered active in heart through single-site mutations. Given that cardiac and visceral cells are both derived from the dorsal mesoderm, this "dormant" TF binding signature may represent a molecular footprint of these cells' developmental lineage.},

Although coarse-grained bead-spring polymer models are commonly used to describe chromatin, the relevant bead dimensions, elastic properties, and the nature of inter-bead potentials are unknown. Using nucleosome-resolution contact probability (Micro-C) data, we systematically coarse-grain chromatin and predict quantities essential for polymer representation of chromatin. We compute size distributions of chromatin beads for different coarse-graining scales, quantify fluctuations and distributions of bond lengths between neighboring regions, and derive effective spring constant values. Unlike the prevalent notion, our findings argue that coarse-grained chromatin beads must be considered as soft particles that can overlap, and we derive an effective inter-bead soft potential and quantify an overlap parameter. We also compute angle distributions giving insights into intrinsic folding and local bendability of chromatin. While the nucleosome-linker DNA bond angle naturally emerges from our work, we show two populations of local structural states. The bead sizes, bond lengths, and bond angles show different mean behavior at Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) boundaries and TAD interiors. We integrate our findings into a coarse-grained polymer model and provide quantitative estimates of all model parameters, which can serve as a foundational basis for all future coarse-grained chromatin simulations.},

A complete understanding of gene regulation will require the mapping of specific chromatin features in small samples of cells at high resolution. Here we describe Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT\&Tag), an enzyme-tethering strategy that provides efficient high-resolution sequencing libraries for profiling diverse chromatin components. In CUT\&Tag, a chromatin protein is bound in situ by a specific antibody, which then tethers a protein A-Tn5 transposase fusion protein. Activation of the transposase efficiently generates fragment libraries with high resolution and exceptionally low background. All steps from live cells to sequencing-ready libraries can be performed in a single tube on the benchtop or a microwell in a high-throughput pipeline, and the entire procedure can be performed in one day. We demonstrate the utility of CUT\&Tag by profiling histone modifications, RNA Polymerase II and transcription factors on low cell numbers and single cells.},

To fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. Using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. We compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. We also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.},

LAMPS-induced condensation at enhancers and promoters activates endogenous gene transcription by chromatin reconfiguration, causing increased chromatin accessibility and de novo formation of long-range chromosomal loops. Proteomic profiling of light-induced condensates by dCas9-mediated affinity purification uncovers multivalent interaction-dependent remodeling of macromolecular composition, resulting in the selective enrichment of transcriptional coactivators and chromatin structure proteins. Our findings support a model whereby the formation of nuclear condensates at native genomic loci reconfigures chromatin architecture and multiprotein assemblies to modulate gene transcription. Hence, LAMPS facilitates mechanistic interrogation of the relationship between nuclear condensation, genome structure, and gene transcription in living cells.},

Integration of a nanoscale device enabled us to isolate single cells on the platform, and thereby relate single-cell m6A modification states to gene expression signatures and cell surface markers. Application of the platform to MUTZ3 leukemia cells revealed a marked reduction in cellular m6A levels as CD34+ leukemic progenitors differentiate to CD14+ myeloid cells.

A central goal in human genetics is to understand the function of such noncoding regions: given a region that is statistically associated with changes in gene expression (expression quantitative trait locus [eQTL]), does it in fact play a regulatory role? And if so, how is this role ``coded'' in its sequence? These questions were the subject of the Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation eQTL challenge. Participants were given a set of sequences that flank eQTLs in humans and were asked to predict whether these are capable of regulating transcription (as evaluated by massively parallel reporter assays), and whether this capability changes between alternative alleles. Here, we report lessons learned from this community effort. By inspecting predictive properties in isolation, and conducting meta-analysis over the competing methods, we find that using chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding as features in an ensemble of classifiers or regression models leads to the most accurate results. We then characterize the loci that are harder to predict, putting the spotlight on areas of weakness, which we expect to be the subject of future studies.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers integrate positional and temporal information to regulate the complex expression of developmentally controlled genes. Current models suggest that enhancers act as computational devices, receiving multiple inputs from activators and repressors and resolving them into a single positive or a negative signal that is transmitted to the basal transcriptional machinery. We show that a simple, compact enhancer is capable of representing both repressed and activated states at the same time and in the same nucleus. This finding suggests that closely apposed factor binding sites, situated within compact cis-elements, can be independently interpreted by the transcriptional machinery, possibly through successive enhancer-promoter interactions. These results provide clear evidence that the computational functions usually ascribed to the enhancer itself are actually shared with the basal machinery. In contrast to the autonomous computer model of enhancer function, an information-display or `billboard' model of enhancer activity may better describe many developmentally regulated transcriptional enhancers.},

To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.},

Proper control of DNA methylation is not only crucial for regulating gene transcription, but its broader consequences include maintaining the integrity of the genome and modulating immune response. Here, we describe the aberrant DNA methylation changes that take place in cancer and how they contribute to the disease phenotype.

However, the three-dimensional organization of chromatin in WGD cells and its contribution to oncogenic phenotypes are currently unknown. Here we show that in p53-deficient cells, WGD induces loss of chromatin segregation (LCS). This event is characterized by reduced segregation between short and long chromosomes, A and B subcompartments and adjacent chromatin domains. LCS is driven by the downregulation of CTCF and H3K9me3 in cells that bypassed activation of the tetraploid checkpoint. Longitudinal analyses revealed that LCS primes genomic regions for subcompartment repositioning in WGD cells. This results in chromatin and epigenetic changes associated with oncogene activation in tumours ensuing from WGD cells. Notably, subcompartment repositioning events were largely independent of chromosomal alterations, which indicates that these were complementary mechanisms contributing to tumour development and progression. Overall, LCS initiates chromatin conformation changes that ultimately result in oncogenic epigenetic and transcriptional modifications, which suggests that chromatin evolution is a hallmark of WGD-driven cancer.},

It results from an accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes in colon epithelial cells that transforms them into adenocarcinomas. There have been major advances in our understanding of cancer epigenetics over the last decade, particularly regarding aberrant DNA methylation. Assessment of the colon cancer epigenome has revealed that virtually all colorectal cancers have aberrantly methylated genes and the average colorectal cancer methylome has hundreds to thousands of abnormally methylated genes. As with gene mutations in the cancer genome, a subset of these methylated genes, called driver genes, is presumed to play a functional role in colorectal cancer. The assessment of methylated genes in colorectal cancers has also revealed a unique molecular subgroup of colorectal cancers called CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) cancers; these tumors have a particularly high frequency of methylated genes. The advances in our understanding of aberrant methylation in colorectal cancer has led to epigenetic alterations being developed as clinical biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic applications. Progress in the assessment of epigenetic alterations in colorectal cancer and their clinical applications has shown that these alterations will be commonly used in the near future as molecular markers to direct the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.},

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that control glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) proliferation and drug resistance may reveal opportunities for therapeutic interventions. Here we show that GSCs can reversibly transition to a slow-cycling, persistent state in response to targeted kinase inhibitors. In this state, GSCs upregulate primitive developmental programs and are dependent upon Notch signaling. This transition is accompanied by widespread redistribution of~repressive histone methylation. Accordingly, persister GSCs upregulate, and are dependent on, the histone demethylases KDM6A/B. Slow-cycling cells with high Notch activity and histone demethylase expression are present in primary glioblastomas before treatment, potentially contributing to relapse. Our findings illustrate how cancer cells may hijack aspects of native developmental programs for deranged proliferation, adaptation, and tolerance.

Using genome-wide Chromatin Interaction Analysis with Paired-End-Tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), we mapped long-range chromatin interactions associated with RNA polymerase II in human cells and uncovered widespread promoter-centered intra-genic, extra-genic and inter-genic interactions. These interactions further aggregated into higher-order clusters, wherein proximal and distal genes were engaged through promoter-promoter interactions. Most genes with promoter-promoter interactions were active and transcribed cooperatively, and some interacting promoters could influence each other implying combinatorial complexity of transcriptional controls. Comparative analyses of different cell lines showed that cell-specific chromatin interactions could provide structural frameworks for cell-specific transcription, and suggested significant enrichment of enhancer-promoter interactions for cell-specific functions. Furthermore, genetically-identified disease-associated non-coding elements were found to be spatially engaged with corresponding genes through long-range interactions. Overall, our study provides insights into the transcription regulation by three-dimensional chromatin interactions for both housekeeping and cell-specific genes in human cells.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles in central airway epithelial cells (AECs) may play a key role in pathological processes in asthma. The goal of the current study is to compare the diagnostic performance of DNAm markers across three tissues: AECs, nasal epithelial cells (NECs), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Additionally, we focused on the results using the machine learning algorithm in the context of multi-locus effects to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the optimal subset of CpG sites. We obtained 74 subjects with asthma and 41 controls from AECs, 15 subjects with asthma and 14 controls from NECs, 697 subjects with asthma and 97 controls from PBMCs. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation levels in AECs, NECs and PBMCs were measured using the Infinium Human Methylation 450\,K BeadChip. Overlap analysis across the three different sample sources at the locus and pathway levels were studied to investigate shared or unique pathophysiological processes of asthma across tissues. Using the top 100 asthma-associated methylation markers as classifiers from each dataset, we found that both AEC- and NEC-based DNAm signatures exerted a lower classification error than the PBMC-based DNAm markers (p-value\,=\,0.0002). The area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis based on out-of-bag errors using the random forest classification algorithm revealed that PBMC-, NEC-, and AEC-based methylation data yielded 31 loci (AUC: 0.87), 8 loci (AUC: 0.99), and 4 loci (AUC: 0.97) from each optimal subset of tissue-specific markers, respectively. We also discovered the locus-locus interaction of DNAm levels of the CDH6 gene and RAPGEF3 gene might interact with each other to jointly predict the risk of asthma -- which suggests the pivotal role of cell-cell junction in the pathological changes of asthma. Both AECs and NECs might provide better diagnostic accuracy and efficacy levels than PBMCs. Further research is warranted to evaluate how these tissue-specific DNAm markers classify and predict asthma risk.},

  abstract = {Motivation Hi-C is the most widely used assay for investigating genome-wide 3D organization of chromatin. When working with Hi-C data, it is often useful to calculate the similarity between contact matrices in order to assess experimental reproducibility or to quantify relationships among Hi-C data from related samples. The HiCRep algorithm has been widely adopted for this task, but the existing R implementation suffers from run time limitations on high-resolution Hi-C data or on large single-cell Hi-C datasets. Results We introduce a Python implementation of HiCRep and demonstrate that it is much faster and consumes much less memory than the existing R implementation. Furthermore, we give examples of HiCRep's ability to accurately distinguish replicates from non-replicates and to reveal cell type structure among collections of Hi-C data.

  abstract = {Regulation of gene expression requires both transcription factor (TFs) and epigenetic modifications, and interplays between the two types of factors have been discovered. However study of relationships between chromatin features and TF--TF co-occupancy remains limited. Here, we revealed the relationship by first illustrating distinct profile patterns of chromatin features related to different binding events, including single TF binding and TF--TF co-occupancy of 71 TFs from five human cell lines. We further implemented statistical analyses to demonstrate the relationship by accurately predicting co-occupancy genome-widely using chromatin features including DNase I hypersensitivity, 11 histone modifications (HMs) and GC content. Remarkably, our results showed that the combination of chromatin features enables accurate predictions across the five cells. For individual chromatin features, DNase I enables high and consistent predictions. H3K27ac, H3K4me 2, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac are more reliable predictors than other HMs. Although the combination of 11 HMs achieves accurate predictions, their predictive ability varies considerably when a model obtained from one cell is applied to others, indicating relationship between HMs and TF--TF co-occupancy is cell type dependent. GC content is not a reliable predictor, but the addition of GC content to any other features enhances their predictive ability. Together, our results elucidate a strong relationship between TF--TF co-occupancy and chromatin features.},

While the molecular mechanisms of rRNA transcription regulation have been elucidated in great detail, the functional organization of the multicopy rRNA gene clusters (rDNA) in the nucleolus is less well understood. Here we apply super-resolution 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to investigate the spatial organization of transcriptionally competent active rDNA chromatin at size scales well below the diffraction limit by optical microscopy. We identify active rDNA chromatin units exhibiting uniformly ring-shaped conformations with diameters of {\textasciitilde}240\,nm in mouse and {\textasciitilde}170\,nm in human fibroblasts, consistent with rDNA looping. The active rDNA chromatin units are clearly separated from each other and from the surrounding areas of rRNA processing. Simultaneous imaging of all active genes bound by Pol I and the architectural chromatin protein Upstream Binding Transcription Factor (UBF) reveals a random spatial orientation of regular repeats of rDNA coding sequences within the nucleoli. These observations imply rDNA looping and exclude potential formation of systematic spatial assemblies of the well-ordered repetitive arrays of transcription units. Collectively, this study uncovers key features of the 3D organization of active rDNA chromatin units and their nucleolar clusters providing a spatial framework of nucleolar chromatin organization at unprecedented detail.},

We generate a catalog of bona fide bivalent genes in ESCs and demonstrate that loss of MLL2 leads to increased Polycomb occupancy. Consequently, promoters lose accessibility, long-range interactions are redistributed, and ESCs fail to differentiate. We pose that bivalency balances accessibility and long-range connectivity of promoters, allowing developmental gene expression to be properly modulated.},

Here, we show that DNA methylation is enriched in included alternatively spliced exons (ASEs), and that inhibition of DNA methylation results in aberrant splicing of ASEs. The methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 is enriched in included ASEs, particularly those that are also highly methylated, and inhibition of DNA methylation disrupts specific targeting of MeCP2 to exons. Interestingly, ablation of MeCP2 results in increased histone acetylation and aberrant ASE-skipping events. We further show that inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity leads to exon skipping that shows a highly significant degree of overlap with that caused by MeCP2 knockdown. Together, our data indicate that intragenic DNA methylation operates in exon definition to modulate alternative RNA splicing and can enhance exon recognition via recruitment of the multifunctional protein MeCP2, which thereby maintains local histone hypoacetylation through the subsequent recruitment of HDACs.},

  abstract = {Genetic studies promise to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes (T2D). Variants associated with T2D are often located in tissue-specific enhancer clusters or super-enhancers. So far, such domains have been defined through clustering of enhancers in linear genome maps rather than in three-dimensional (3D) space. Furthermore, their target genes are often unknown. We have created promoter capture Hi-C maps in human pancreatic islets. This linked diabetes-associated enhancers to their target genes, often located hundreds of kilobases away. It also revealed {$>$}1,300 groups of islet enhancers, super-enhancers and active promoters that form 3D hubs, some of which show coordinated glucose-dependent activity. We demonstrate that genetic variation in hubs impacts insulin secretion heritability, and show that hub annotations can be used for polygenic scores that predict T2D risk driven by islet regulatory variants. Human islet 3D chromatin architecture, therefore, provides a framework for interpretation of T2D genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals.},

These pathways may be determined on the basis of three molecular features: (i) mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, leading to a DNA microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype, (ii) mutations in APC and other genes that activate Wnt pathway, characterized by chromosomal instability (CIN) phenotype, and (iii) global genome hypermethylation, resulting in switch off of tumor suppressor genes, indicated as CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). Each of these pathways is characterized by specific pathological features, mechanisms of carcinogenesis and process of tumor development. The molecular aspects of these pathways have been used clinically in the diagnosis, screening and management of patients with colorectal cancer. In this review we especially describe various aspects of CIMP, one of the important and rather recently discovered pathways that lead to colorectal cancer.},

In contrast, in higher organisms that have larger genomes, TFs recognize sequences that are too short to define unique genomic positions. In addition, development of multicellular organisms requires molecular systems that are capable of executing combinatorial logical operations. Co-operative recognition of DNA by multiple TFs allows both definition of unique genomic positions in large genomes, and complex information processing at the level of individual regulatory elements. The TFs can co-operate in multiple different ways, and the precise mechanism used for co-operation determines important features of the regulatory interactions. Here, we present an overview of the structural basis of the different mechanisms by which TFs can cooperate, focusing on insight from recent functional studies and structural analyses of specific TF-TF-DNA complexes.},

Proper functioning of chromatin further involves a network of interactions among molecular complexes that modify chromatin structure and organization to affect the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors leading to the activation or repression of the transcription of target DNA loci. Based on its structure and compaction state, chromatin is categorized into euchromatin, heterochromatin, and centromeric chromatin. In this review, we discuss distinct chromatin factors and molecular complexes that constitute euchromatin---open chromatin structure associated with active transcription; heterochromatin---less accessible chromatin associated with silencing; centromeric chromatin---the site of spindle binding in chromosome segregation.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            DNA replication enables genetic inheritance across the kingdoms of life. Replication occurs with a defined temporal order known as the replication timing (RT) programme, leading to organization of the genome into early- or late-replicating regions. RT is cell-type specific, is tightly linked to the three-dimensional nuclear organization of the genome               1,2               and is considered an epigenetic fingerprint               3               . In spite of its importance in maintaining the epigenome               4               , the developmental regulation of RT in mammals in vivo has not been explored. Here, using single-cell Repli-seq               5               , we generated genome-wide RT maps of mouse embryos from the zygote to the blastocyst stage. Our data show that RT is initially not well defined but becomes defined progressively from the 4-cell stage, coinciding with strengthening of the A and B compartments. We show that transcription contributes to the precision of the RT programme and that the difference in RT between the A and B compartments depends on RNA polymerase\,II at zygotic genome activation. Our data indicate that the establishment of nuclear organization precedes the acquisition of defined RT features and primes the partitioning of the genome into early- and late-replicating domains. Our work sheds light on the establishment of the epigenome at the beginning of mammalian development and reveals the organizing principles of genome organization.},

Focusing on chromosomal regions that contribute to compartments, we discover distinct structures that, in spite of considerable variability, can predict whether such regions correspond to active (A-type) or inactive (B-type) compartments. Imaging through the depths of entire nuclei, we capture pairs of homologous regions in diploid cells, obtaining evidence that maternal and paternal homologous regions can be differentially organized. Finally, using restraint-based modeling to integrate imaging and Hi-C data, we implement a method--integrative modeling of genomic regions (IMGR)--to increase the genomic resolution of our traces to 10 kb.},

The canonical TF accomplishes this with two domains, one that binds specific DNA sequences and the other that binds protein coactivators or corepressors. We find that at least half of TFs also bind RNA, doing so through a previously unrecognized domain with sequence and functional features analogous to the arginine-rich motif of the HIV transcriptional activator Tat. RNA binding contributes to TF function by promoting the dynamic association between DNA, RNA, and TF on chromatin. TF-RNA interactions are a conserved feature important for vertebrate development and disrupted in disease. We propose that the ability to bind DNA, RNA, and protein is a general property of many TFs and is fundamental to their gene regulatory function.},

Using ChromEMT (ChromEM tomography), we reveal the ultrastructure and three-dimensional (3D) organization of individual chromatin polymers, megabase domains, and mitotic chromosomes. We show that chromatin is a disordered 5- to 24-nanometer-diameter curvilinear chain that is packed together at different 3D concentration distributions in interphase and mitosis.

  abstract = {This chapter provides an introduction to chromatin. We will examine the organization of the genome into a nucleosomal structure. DNA is wrapped around a globular complex of 8 core histone proteins, two of each histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. This nucleosomal arrangement is the context in which information can be established along the sequence of the DNA for regulating different aspects of the chromosome, including transcription, DNA replication and repair processes, recombination, kinetochore function, and telomere function. Posttranslational modifications of histone proteins and modifications of DNA bases underlie chromatin-based epigenetic regulation. Enzymes that catalyze histone modifications are considered writers. Conceptually, erasers remove these modifications, and readers are proteins binding these modifications and can target specific functions. On a larger scale, the 3-dimensional (3D) organization of chromatin in the nucleus also contributes to gene regulation. Whereas chromosomes are condensed during mitosis and segregated during cell division, they occupy discrete volumes called chromosome territories during interphase. Looping or folding of DNA can bring regulatory elements including enhancers close to gene promoters. Recent techniques facilitate understanding of 3D contacts at high resolution.

Recent studies in 3D genomics inferred the very basic functional chromatin folding structures known as chromatin loops, the long-range chromatin interactions that are mediated by protein factors and dynamically extruded by cohesin. We combined the use of FISH staining of a very short (33~kb) chromatin fragment, interferometric photoactivated localization microscopy (iPALM), and traveling salesman problem-based heuristic loop reconstruction algorithm from an image of the one of the strongest CTCF-mediated chromatin loops in human lymphoblastoid cells. In total, we have generated thirteen good quality images of the target chromatin region with 2-22~nm oligo probe localization precision. We visualized the shape of the single chromatin loops with unprecedented genomic resolution which allowed us to study the structural heterogeneity of chromatin looping. We were able to compare the physical distance maps from all reconstructed image-driven computational models with contact frequencies observed by ChIA-PET and Hi-C genomic-driven methods to examine the concordance between single cell imaging and population based genomic data.},

One of the key goals of mammalian cell-type identity studies, in both normal differentiation and disease, is to locate differential methylation patterns across the genome. We discuss the most desirable characteristics for DML (differentially methylated locus) and DMR (differentially methylated region) detection tools in a genome-wide context and choose a set of statistical methods that fully or partially satisfy these considerations to compare for benchmarking. Our data simulation strategy is both biologically informed-employing distribution parameters derived from large-scale consortium datasets-and thorough. We report DML detection ability with respect to coverage, group methylation difference, sample size, variability and covariate size, both marginally and jointly, and exhaustively with respect to parameter combination. We also benchmark these methods on FDR control and computational time. We use this result to backend and introduce an expanded version of DMRcate: an existing DMR detection tool for microarray data that we have extended to now call DMRs from WGBS data. We compare DMRcate to a set of alternative DMR callers using a similarly realistic simulation strategy. We find DMRcate and RADmeth are the best predictors of DMRs, and conclusively find DMRcate the fastest.},

PNA is an example of novel synthetic oligonucleotide "mimetic" which has a higher affinity than regular oligonucleotide (RNA or DNA) probes for complementary single-strand (ss) DNA sequences. PNA oligonucleotides have excellent penetration properties due to their small size (typically 15 to 18-mers) and can be directly labeled with fluorochromes. These properties have been exploited to develop quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) onto denatured single-stranded chromosomal DNA target sequences. The latter can be present in preparations of fixed metaphase cells on slides (Q-FISH) or in heat-treated (interphase) cells in suspension (flow-FISH).},

  abstract = {Nucleosomes cluster together when chromatin folds in the cell to form heterogeneous groups termed "clutches". These structural units add another level of chromatin regulation, for example during cell differentiation. Yet, the mechanisms that regulate their size and compaction remain obscure. Here, using our chromatin mesoscale model, we dissect clutch patterns in fibers with different combinations of nucleosome positions, linker histone density, and acetylation levels to investigate their role in clutch regulation. First, we isolate the effect of each chromatin parameter by studying systems with regular nucleosome spacing; second, we design systems with naturally-occurring linker lengths that fold onto specific clutch patterns; third, we model gene-encoding fibers to understand how these combined factors contribute to gene structure. Our results show how these chromatin parameters act together to produce different-sized nucleosome clutches. The length of nucleosome free regions (NFRs) profoundly affects clutch size, while the length of linker DNA has a moderate effect. In general, higher linker histone densities produce larger clutches by a chromatin compaction mechanism, while higher acetylation levels produce smaller clutches by a chromatin unfolding mechanism. We also show that it is possible to design fibers with naturally-occurring DNA linkers and NFRs that fold onto specific clutch patterns. Finally, in gene-encoding systems, a complex combination of variables dictates a gene-specific clutch pattern. Together, these results shed light into the mechanisms that regulate nucleosome clutches and suggest a new epigenetic mechanism by which chromatin parameters regulate transcriptional activity via the three-dimensional folded state of the genome at a nucleosome level.},

The methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 is frequently mutated in hematological disorders, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and has been suggested to protect CG dinucleotide (CpG) islands and promoters from aberrant DNA methylation. In this study, we present a novel Tet2-dependent leukemia mouse model that closely recapitulates gene expression profiles and hallmarks of human AML1-ETO-induced AML. Using this model, we show that the primary effect of Tet2 loss in preleukemic hematopoietic cells is progressive and widespread DNA hypermethylation affecting up to 25\% of active enhancer elements. In contrast, CpG island and promoter methylation does not change in a Tet2-dependent manner but increases relative to population doublings. We confirmed this specific enhancer hypermethylation phenotype in human AML patients with TET2 mutations. Analysis of immediate gene expression changes reveals rapid deregulation of a large number of genes implicated in tumorigenesis, including many down-regulated tumor suppressor genes. Hence, we propose that TET2 prevents leukemic transformation by protecting enhancers from aberrant DNA methylation and that it is the combined silencing of several tumor suppressor genes in TET2 mutated hematopoietic cells that contributes to increased stem cell proliferation and leukemogenesis.},

We find that deletion of Tet2 in native hematopoiesis as well as fully transformed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) results in changes in transcription factor (TF) activity within these regions, and we provide evidence that loss of TET2 leads to attenuation of chromatin binding of members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TF family. Together, these findings demonstrate that TET2 activity shapes the local chromatin environment at enhancers to facilitate TF binding and provides an example of how epigenetic dysregulation can affect gene expression patterns and drive disease development.},

Numerous methods for measuring genome-wide chromatin accessibility have been developed in the genomic era to interrogate the function of chromatin regulators. A recent technique which has gained widespread use due to speed and low input requirements with native chromatin is the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin, or ATAC-seq. Biologists have since used this method to compare chromatin accessibility between two cellular conditions. However, approaches for calculating differential accessibility can yield conflicting results, and little emphasis is placed on choice of normalization method during differential ATAC-seq analysis, especially when global chromatin alterations might be expected.                                         Results               Using an in vivo ATAC-seq data set generated in our recent report, we observed differences in chromatin accessibility patterns depending on the data normalization method used to calculate differential accessibility. This observation was further verified on published ATAC-seq data from yeast. We propose a generalized workflow for differential accessibility analysis using ATAC-seq data. We further show this workflow identifies sites of differential chromatin accessibility that correlate with gene expression and is sensitive to differential analysis using negative controls.

Results               Using an in vivo ATAC-seq data set generated in our recent report, we observed differences in chromatin accessibility patterns depending on the data normalization method used to calculate differential accessibility. This observation was further verified on published ATAC-seq data from yeast. We propose a generalized workflow for differential accessibility analysis using ATAC-seq data. We further show this workflow identifies sites of differential chromatin accessibility that correlate with gene expression and is sensitive to differential analysis using negative controls.                                         Conclusions               We argue that researchers should systematically compare multiple normalization methods before continuing with differential accessibility analysis. ATAC-seq users should be aware of the interpretations of potential bias within experimental data and the assumptions of the normalization method implemented.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

Here, we provide an overview of how enhancers and promoters construct regulatory landscapes and how multiple scales of 3D chromatin structure sculpt their communication. We focus on emerging views of what enhancer-promoter contacts and chromatin domains physically represent and how two antagonistic fundamental forces---loop extrusion and homotypic attraction---likely form them. We also examine how these same forces spatially separate regulatory landscapes by functional state, thereby creating higher-order compartments that reconfigure during development to enable proper enhancer-promoter communication.},

The use of these techniques provides complementary information on average spatial distances (FISH) and contact probabilities (3C) for specific genomic sites. To infer the structure of the chromatin fiber or to distinguish functional interactions from random colocalization, it is useful to compare experimental data to predictions from statistical fiber models. The current estimates of the fiber stiffness derived from FISH and 3C differ by a factor of 5. They are based on the wormlike chain model and a heuristic modification of the Shimada-Yamakawa theory of looping for unkinkable, unconstrained, zero-diameter filaments. Here, we provide an extended theoretical and computational framework to explain the currently available experimental data for various species on the basis of a unique, minimal model of decondensing chromosomes: a kinkable, topologically constraint, semiflexible polymer with the (FISH) Kuhn length of lK = 300 nm, 10 kinks per Mbp, and a contact distance of 45 nm. In particular: 1), we reconsider looping of finite-diameter filaments on the basis of an analytical approximation (novel, to our knowledge) of the wormlike chain radial density and show that unphysically large contact radii would be required to explain the 3C data based on the FISH estimate of the fiber stiffness; 2),~we demonstrate that the observed interaction frequencies at short genomic lengths can be explained by the presence of a low concentration of curvature defects (kinks); and 3), we show that the most recent experimental 3C data for human chromosomes are in quantitative agreement with interaction frequencies extracted from our simulations of topologically confined model chromosomes.},

In particular, we show that the experimentally observed territory shapes and spatial distances between marked chromosome sites for human, Drosophila, and budding yeast chromosomes can be reproduced by a parameter-free minimal model of decondensing chromosomes. Our results suggest that the observed interphase structure and dynamics are due to generic polymer effects: confined Brownian motion conserving the local topological state of long chain molecules and segregation of mutually unentangled chains due to topological constraints.},

The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase-separated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts. These results support the idea that coactivators form phase-separated condensates at SEs that compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus, suggest a role for coactivator IDRs in this process, and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell-identity genes.},

However, despite recent efforts, direct visualization and quantification of this process in single cells remains an open challenge. Here, we use polymer simulations and dedicated analysis methods to explore if, and under which conditions, DNA loop extrusion can be detected and quantitatively characterized by imaging pairs of fluorescently labeled loci located near loop or TAD anchors in fixed or living cells. We find that under realistic conditions, extrusion can be detected and the frequency of loop formation can be quantified from fixed cell images alone, while the lifetime of loops and the speed of extrusion can be estimated from dynamic live-cell data. Our delineation of appropriate imaging conditions and the proposed analytical methods lay the groundwork for a systematic quantitative characterization of loop extrusion in fixed or living cells.},

As such, R loops seem to be a cause of tumorigenesis.Cells have two ways to limit the number of R loops in the genome: mechanisms that remove R loops, such as ribonucleases and RNA--DNA helicases; and mechanisms that prevent R-loop accumulation, such as RNA-processing factors or topoisomerase 1.R loops may play a part in transcription activation by directly affecting the chromatin structure of promoters and the recruitment of transcription or chromatin-remodelling factors. Such R loops may be formed by antisense non-coding RNAs.R loops trigger chromatin condensation and heterochromatin formation, which may explain their ability to repress or silence gene expression and to stall replication-fork progression, putatively leading to replication-fork breakage as the main source of R-loop-mediated genome instability.BRCA1 and BRCA2 have functions in double-strand break repair and/or replication-fork protection that may contribute to resolving intermediate structures such as stalled or broken replication forks that are generated as a consequence of R loops --- thus these proteins facilitate the removal of R loops.},

Self-renewal is the ability to give rise to HSC itself without differentiation. Since mature blood cells are predominantly short lived, HSC continuously provide more differentiated progenitors while properly maintaining the HSC pool size properly throughout life by precisely balancing self-renewal and differentiation. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of self-renewal and differentiation of HSC has been a central issue.

SELEX assays identified consensus binding sites that permitted the characterization of several immunity regulatory DNAs. The distribution of REL and GATA sites within these DNAs suggests that most or all fat-specific immunity genes contain a common organization of regulatory elements: closely linked REL and GATA binding sites positioned in the same orientation and located near the transcription start site. Aspects of this "regulatory code" are essential for the immune response. These results suggest that immunity regulatory DNAs contain constrained organizational features, which may be a general property of eukaryotic enhancers.},

Our design strikes a balance between expanding coverage of regulatory elements and reproducibly enriching informative CpG dinucleotides in promoters, enhancers and CTCF binding sites. Barcoded DNA fragments are pooled before bisulfite conversion, allowing multiplex processing and technical consistency in low-input samples. Application of XRBS to single leukemia cells enabled us to evaluate genetic copy number variations and methylation variability across individual cells. Our analysis highlights heterochromatic H3K9me3 regions as having the highest cell-to-cell variability in their methylation, likely reflecting inherent epigenetic instability of these late-replicating regions, compounded by differences in cell cycle stages among sampled cells.},

In vitro, motion of nucleosome arrays can be accurately modeled by assuming a Kuhn length of 35-55 nm. In vivo, the amplitude of chromosome fluctuations is drastically reduced, and depends on transcription. Transcription activation increases chromatin dynamics only if it involves gene relocalization, while global transcriptional inhibition augments the fluctuations, yet without relocalization. Chromatin fiber motion is accounted for by a model of equilibrium fluctuations of a polymer chain, in which random contacts along the chromosome contour induce an excess of internal friction. Simulations that reproduce chromosome conformation capture and imaging data corroborate this hypothesis. This model unravels the transient nature of chromosome contacts, characterized by a life time of {$\sim$}2 seconds and a free energy of formation of {$\sim$}1 kBT.},

Current technology measures methylation in hundred of thousands, or millions of CpG sites throughout the genome. It is evident that neighboring CpG sites are often highly correlated with each other, and current literature suggests that clusters of adjacent CpG sites are co-regulated. RESULTS: We develop the Adjacent Site Clustering (A-clustering) algorithm to detect sets of neighboring CpG sites that are correlated with each other. To detect methylation regions associated with exposure, we propose an analysis pipeline for high-dimensional methylation data in which CpG sites within regions identified by A-clustering are modeled as multivariate responses to environmental exposure using a generalized estimating equation approach that assumes exposure equally affects all sites in the cluster. We develop a correlation preserving simulation scheme, and study the proposed methodology via simulations. We study the clusters detected by the algorithm on high dimensional dataset of peripheral blood methylation of pesticide applicators. AVAILABILITY: We provide the R package Aclust that efficiently implements the A-clustering and the analysis pipeline, and produces analysis reports.

The function consists of three parts that suggest three possible sources of the correlation: movement of enzymes along DNA, collaboration between DNA methylation and nucleosome modification, and global enzyme concentrations within a cell. Moreover, the collaboration strength between DNA methylation and nucleosome modification is universal for mouse early embryo cells. The obtained correlation function provide insightful understanding for the mechanisms of inheritance of DNA methylation patterns.},

Dynamic DNA methylation is driven by the balance between DNA methyltransferases and transcription factor binding on one side and co-regulated with the Mediator complex recruitment and H3K27ac level changes at regulatory elements on the other side. DNA methylation at the Sox2 and the Mir290 SEs is independently regulated and has distinct consequences on the cellular differentiation state.

We find that compact-to-elongated transitions are smooth and fast in only half of the trajectories. In the other half, the elongation is jammed halfway by the formation of backfolded, needle-like states. These states, which have not been envisioned before, have lifetimes that are orders of magnitude larger than the chain's relaxation time and ought to be detectable with current single-molecule experimental setups.}

Such priming is accompanied by increased chromatin accessibility, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we analyze the effect of Zld on genome-wide nucleosome occupancy and binding of the patterning TF Dorsal (Dl). Our results show that early enhancers are characterized by an intrinsically high nucleosome barrier. Zld tackles this nucleosome barrier through local depletion of nucleosomes with the effect being dependent on the number and position of Zld motifs. Without Zld, Dl binding decreases at enhancers and redistributes to open regions devoid of enhancer activity. We propose that Zld primes enhancers by lowering the high nucleosome barrier just enough to assist TFs in accessing their binding motifs and promoting spatially controlled enhancer activation if the right patterning TFs are present. We envision that genome activators in general will utilize this mechanism to activate the zygotic genome in a robust and precise manner.},

  abstract = {CpG islands are useful markers for genes in organisms containing 5-methylcytosine in their genomes. In addition, CpG islands located in the promoter regions of genes can play important roles in gene silencing during processes such as X-chromosome inactivation, imprinting, and silencing of intragenomic parasites. The generally accepted definition of what constitutes a CpG island was proposed in 1987 by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer [Gardiner-Garden, M. \& Frommer, M. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196, 261--282] as being a 200-bp stretch of DNA with a C+G content of 50\% and an observed CpG/expected CpG in excess of 0.6. Any definition of a CpG island is somewhat arbitrary, and this one, which was derived before the sequencing of mammalian genomes, will include many sequences that are not necessarily associated with controlling regions of genes but rather are associated with intragenomic parasites. We have therefore used the complete genomic sequences of human chromosomes 21 and 22 to examine the properties of CpG islands in different sequence classes by using a search algorithm that we have developed. Regions of DNA of greater than 500 bp with a G+C equal to or greater than 55\% and observed CpG/expected CpG of 0.65 were more likely to be associated with the 5{$\prime$} regions of genes and this definition excluded most Alu-repetitive elements. We also used genome sequences to show strong CpG suppression in the human genome and slight suppression in Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This finding is compatible with the recent detection of 5-methylcytosine in Drosophila, and might suggest that S. cerevisiae has, or once had, CpG methylation.},

In recent years, a variety of post-hoc attribution methods have been proposed for addressing this neural network interpretability problem in the context of gene regulation. Here we describe a complementary way of approaching this problem. Our strategy is based on the observation that two large classes of biophysical models of cis-regulatory mechanisms can be expressed as deep neural networks in which nodes and weights have explicit physiochemical interpretations. We also demonstrate how such biophysical networks can be rapidly inferred, using modern deep learning frameworks, from the data produced by certain types of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). These results suggest a scalable strategy for using MPRAs to systematically characterize the biophysical basis of gene regulation in a wide range of biological contexts. They also highlight gene regulation as a promising venue for the development of scientifically interpretable approaches to deep learning.},

ATAC-seq technology effectively identifies active cis-REs in a given cell type (including from single cells) by mapping accessible chromatin at base-pair resolution. However, these maps are not immediately useful for inferring specific functions of cis-REs. For this purpose, we developed a deep learning framework (CoRE-ATAC) with novel data encoders that integrate DNA sequence (reference or personal genotypes) with ATAC-seq cut sites and read pileups. CoRE-ATAC was trained on 4 cell types (n = 6 samples/replicates) and accurately predicted known cis-RE functions from 7 cell types (n = 40 samples) that were not used in model training (mean average precision = 0.80, mean F1 score = 0.70). CoRE-ATAC enhancer predictions from 19 human islet samples coincided with genetically modulated gain/loss of enhancer activity, which was confirmed by massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). Finally, CoRE-ATAC effectively inferred cis-RE function from aggregate single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC) data from human blood-derived immune cells that overlapped with known functional annotations in sorted immune cells, which established the efficacy of these models to study cis-RE functions of rare cells without the need for cell sorting. ATAC-seq maps from primary human cells reveal individual- and cell-specific variation in cis-RE activity. CoRE-ATAC increases the functional resolution of these maps, a critical step for studying regulatory disruptions behind diseases.},

Chromosome conformation capture techniques, such as Hi-C, generate large amounts of data showing interaction points on the genome but these are hard to interpret using standard tools. RESULTS: We have developed CSynth, an interactive 3D genome browser and real-time chromatin restraint-based modeller to visualize models of any chromosome conformation capture (3C) data. Unlike other modelling systems, CSynth allows dynamic interaction with the modelling parameters to allow experimentation and effects on the model. It also allows comparison of models generated from data in different tissues/cell states and the results of third-party 3D modelling outputs. In addition, we include an option to view and manipulate these complicated structures using Virtual Reality (VR) so scientists can immerse themselves in the models for further understanding. This VR component has also proven to be a valuable teaching and a public engagement tool. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: CSynth is web based and available to use at csynth.org.

We previously developed a reconstruction method to resolve the 3D architecture of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes using 3C-based data. These models were congruent with fluorescent imaging validation. However, the limits of such methods have not systematically been assessed. Here we propose the first evaluation of a mean-field restraint-based reconstruction of genomes by considering diverse chromosome architectures and different levels of data noise and structural variability. The results show that: first, current scoring functions for 3D reconstruction correlate with the accuracy of the models; second, reconstructed models are robust to noise but sensitive to structural variability; third, the local structure organization of genomes, such as Topologically Associating Domains, results in more accurate models; fourth, to a certain extent, the models capture the intrinsic structural variability in the input matrices and fifth, the accuracy of the models can be a priori predicted by analyzing the properties of the interaction matrices. In summary, our work provides a systematic analysis of the limitations of a mean-field restrain-based method, which could be taken into consideration in further development of methods as well as their applications.},

After decades of effort, 17\% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure1. Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold2, at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool~that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},

  abstract = {Current theories on the conformation and dynamics of unknotted and non-concatenated ring polymers in melt conditions describe each ring as a tree-like double-folded object. While evidence from simulations supports this picture on a single ring level, other works show pairs of rings also thread each other, a feature overlooked in the tree theories. Here we reconcile this dichotomy using Monte Carlo simulations of the ring melts with different bending rigidities. We find that rings are double-folded (more strongly for stiffer rings) on and above the entanglement length scale, while the threadings are localized on smaller scales. The different theories disagree on the details of the tree structure, i.e., the fractal dimension of the backbone of the tree. In the stiffer melts we find an indication of a self-avoiding scaling of the backbone, while more flexible chains do not exhibit such a regime. Moreover, the theories commonly neglect threadings and assign different importance to the impact of the progressive constraint release (tube dilation) on single ring relaxation due to the motion of other rings. Despite that each threading creates only a small opening in the double-folded structure, the threading loops can be numerous and their length can exceed substantially the entanglement scale. We link the threading constraints to the divergence of the relaxation time of a ring, if the tube dilation is hindered by pinning a fraction of other rings in space. Current theories do not predict such divergence and predict faster than measured diffusion of rings, pointing at the relevance of the threading constraints in unpinned systems as well. Revision of the theories with explicit threading constraints might elucidate the validity of the conjectured existence of topological glass.},

The three subsets retained differences in cell size for up to 15 days of primary culture. Flow cytometric (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) measurements of forward-angle light scatter agreed well with fibroblast volume measured by image analysis and confirmed the utility of forward-angle light scatter for discriminating size subpopulations. Group II fibroblasts accumulated most rapidly by 8 days of culture and also contained the greatest proportion of S and G2/M phase cells as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Fibroblasts that were immunoreactive with antibodies to {$\alpha$}-smooth muscle actin ({$\alpha$}-SMA) were found only in group III. In situ end labeling of fragmented DNA detected apoptotic cells in bothgroups II andIII, but double labeling for in situ end labeling and {$\alpha$}-SMA revealed apoptotic cells in both the {$\alpha$}-SMA-positive and -negative populations. These results demonstrate that primary human lung fibroblasts behave as predicted by classic models of cell cycle progression and differentiation. However, they do not support the hypothesis that the expression of {$\alpha$}-actin is related to apoptosis. We also describe a simple and reproducible method for the high-yield isolation of human lung fibroblast subsets of differing proliferative potential and phenotype.},

We then applied a machine learning classifier to distinguish a spectrum of malignant cell types whose abundances varied between patients and between subclones in the same tumor. Cell type compositions correlated with prototypic genetic lesions, including an association of FLT3-ITD with abundant progenitor-like cells. Primitive AML cells exhibited dysregulated transcriptional programs with co-expression of stemness and myeloid priming genes and had prognostic significance. Differentiated monocyte-like AML cells expressed diverse immunomodulatory genes and suppressed T~cell activity in~vitro. In conclusion, we provide single-cell technologies and an atlas of AML cell states, regulators, and markers with implications for precision medicine and immune therapies. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

In CML, the acquisition of the fusion tyrosine kinase BCR--ABL1 in a haematopoietic stem cell drives its transformation to become a LSC. In AML, LSCs can arise from multiple cell types through the activity of a number of oncogenic drivers and pre-leukaemic events, adding further layers of context and genetic and cellular heterogeneity to AML LSCs not observed in most cases of CML. Furthermore, LSCs from both AML and CML can be refractory to standard-of-care therapies and persist in patients, diversify clonally and serve as reservoirs to drive relapse, recurrence or progression to more aggressive forms. Despite these complexities, LSCs in both diseases share biological features, making them distinct from other CML or AML progenitor cells and from normal haematopoietic stem cells. These features may represent Achilles' heels against which novel therapies can be developed. Here, we review many of the similarities and differences that exist between LSCs in CML and AML and examine the therapeutic strategies that could be used to eradicate them.},

  abstract = {TET family enzymes successively oxidize 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine, leading to eventual demethylation. 5hmC and TET enzymes occupy distinct chromatin regions, suggesting unknown mechanisms controlling the fate of 5hmC within diverse chromatin environments. Here, we report that SALL4A preferentially associates with 5hmC in~vitro and occupies enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cells in a largely TET1-dependent manner. Although most 5hmC at SALL4A peaks undergoes further oxidation, this process is abrogated upon deletion of Sall4 gene, with a concomitant reduction of TET2 at these regions. Thus, SALL4A facilitates further oxidation of 5hmC at its binding sites, which requires its 5hmC-binding activity and TET2, supporting a collaborative action between SALL4A and TET proteins in regulating stepwise oxidation of 5mC at enhancers. Our study identifies SALL4A as a 5hmC binder, which facilitates 5hmC oxidation by stabilizing TET2 association, thereby fine-tuning expression profiles of developmental genes in mouse embryonic stem cells.},

Epiphany uses bidirectional long short-term memory layers to capture long-range dependencies and optionally a generative adversarial network architecture to encourage contact map realism.

However, current methods for assessing Hi-C data reproducibility can produce misleading results because they ignore spatial features in Hi-C data, such as domain structure and distance dependence. We present HiCRep, a framework for assessing the reproducibility of Hi-C data that systematically accounts for these features. In particular, we introduce a novel similarity measure, the stratum adjusted correlation coefficient (SCC), for quantifying the similarity between Hi-C interaction matrices. Not only does it provide a statistically sound and reliable evaluation of reproducibility, SCC can also be used to quantify differences between Hi-C contact matrices and to determine the optimal sequencing depth for a desired resolution. The measure consistently shows higher accuracy than existing approaches in distinguishing subtle differences in reproducibility and depicting interrelationships of cell lineages. The proposed measure is straightforward to interpret and easy to compute, making it well-suited for providing standardized, interpretable, automatable, and scalable quality control. The freely available R package HiCRep implements our approach.},

Here, we demonstrate that population-based modeling---from ensemble Hi-C data---provides a detailed description of the nuclear microenvironment of genes and its role in gene function. We define the microenvironment by the subnuclear positions of genomic regions with respect to nuclear bodies, local chromatin compaction, and preferences in chromatin compartmentalization. These structural descriptors are determined in single-cell models, thereby revealing the structural variability between cells. We demonstrate that the microenvironment of a genomic region is linked to its functional potential in gene transcription, replication, and chromatin compartmentalization. Some chromatin regions feature a strong preference for a single microenvironment, due to association with specific nuclear bodies in most cells. Other chromatin shows high structural variability, which is a strong indicator of functional heterogeneity. Moreover, we identify specialized nuclear microenvironments, which distinguish chromatin in different functional states and reveal a key role of nuclear speckles in chromosome organization. We demonstrate that our method produces highly predictive three-dimensional genome structures, which accurately reproduce data from a variety of orthogonal experiments, thus considerably expanding the range of Hi-C data analysis.},

Here, by combining chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP--seq), 3D DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (3D DNA FISH) and polymer simulations, we show that heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) is essential for de novo 3D genome organization during Drosophila early development. The binding of HP1a at pericentromeric heterochromatin is required to establish clustering of pericentromeric regions. Moreover, HP1a binding within chromosome arms is responsible for overall chromosome folding and has an important role in the formation of B-compartment regions. However, depletion of HP1a does not affect the A-compartment, which suggests that a different molecular mechanism segregates active chromosome regions. Our work identifies HP1a as an epigenetic regulator that is involved in establishing the global structure of the genome in the early embryo.},

Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) have important implications for development, aging and diseases. Therefore, genome-wide mapping of DMRs across various temporal and spatial methylomes is important in revealing the impact of epigenetic modifications on heritable phenotypic variation. We present a quantitative approach, quantitative differentially methylated regions (QDMRs), to quantify methylation difference and identify DMRs from genome-wide methylation profiles by adapting Shannon entropy. QDMR was applied to synthetic methylation patterns and methylation profiles detected by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation microarray (MeDIP-chip) in human tissues/cells. This approach can give a reasonable quantitative measure of methylation difference across multiple samples. Then DMR threshold was determined from methylation probability model. Using this threshold, QDMR identified 10,651 tissue DMRs which are related to the genes enriched for cell differentiation, including 4740 DMRs not identified by the method developed by Rakyan et al. QDMR can also measure the sample specificity of each DMR. Finally, the application to methylation profiles detected by reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) in mouse showed the platform-free and species-free nature of QDMR. This approach provides an effective tool for the high-throughput identification of potential functional regions involved in epigenetic regulation.},

Here, we used an inducible transgenic mouse model to delineate rules for abnormal DNMT3B targeting, as well as the constraints of its activity across different cell types. Our results explain the preferential susceptibility of certain CpG islands to aberrant methylation and point to transcriptional state and the associated chromatin landscape as the strongest predictors. Although DNA methylation and H3K27me3 are usually non-overlapping at CpG islands, H3K27me3 can transiently co-occur with DNMT3B-induced DNA methylation. Our genome-wide data combined with ultra-deep locus-specific bisulfite sequencing suggest a distributive activity of ectopically expressed Dnmt3b that leads to discordant CpG island hypermethylation and provides new insights for interpreting the cancer methylome.},

We~identified a local CpG sequence context associated with preferential hypomethylation in PMDs. Analysis of CpGs in this context (`solo-WCGWs') identified previously undetected PMD hypomethylation in almost all healthy tissue types. PMD hypomethylation increased with age, beginning during fetal development, and appeared to track the accumulation of cell divisions. In cancer, PMD hypomethylation depth correlated with somatic mutation density and cell cycle gene expression, consistent with its reflection of mitotic history and suggesting its application as a mitotic clock. We propose that late replication leads to lifelong progressive methylation loss, which acts as a biomarker for cellular aging and which may contribute to oncogenesis.},

The comprehensive elucidation of Drosophila gene networks provides an unprecedented opportunity to apply quantitative models to metazoan enhancers that govern complex patterns of gene expression during development. Models based on the fractional occupancy of defined DNA binding sites have been used to describe the regulation of the lac operon in E. coli and the lysis/lysogeny switch of phage lambda. Here, we apply similar models to enhancers regulated by the Dorsal gradient in the ventral neurogenic ectoderm (vNE) of the early Drosophila embryo. Quantitative models based on the fractional occupancy of Dorsal, Twist, and Snail binding sites raise the possibility that cooperative interactions among these regulatory proteins mediate subtle differences in the vNE expression patterns. Variations in cooperativity may be attributed to differences in the detailed linkage of Dorsal, Twist, and Snail binding sites in vNE enhancers. We propose that binding site occupancy is the key rate-limiting step for establishing localized patterns of gene expression in the early Drosophila embryo.},
