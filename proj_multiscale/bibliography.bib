  abstract = {We perform simulations of a system containing simple model proteins and a polymer representing chromatin. We study the interplay between protein-protein and protein-chromatin interactions, and the resulting condensates that arise due to liquid-liquid phase separation, or a via a ``bridging-induced attraction'' mechanism. For proteins that interact multivalently, we obtain a phase diagram which includes liquid-like droplets, droplets with absorbed polymer, and coated polymer regimes. Of particular interest is a regime where protein droplets only form due to interaction with the polymer; here, unlike a standard phase separating system, droplet density rather than size varies with the overall protein concentration. We also observe that protein dynamics within droplets slow down as chromatin is absorbed. If the protein-protein interactions have a strictly limited valence, fractal or gel-like condensates are instead observed. A specific example that inspired our model is heterochromatin protein 1, or HP1. Recent in~vivo experiments have shown that HP1 exhibits similar droplet size buffering behavior as our simulations. Overall, our results provide biologically relevant insights into the general nature of protein-chromatin condensates in living cells.},

Although diverse methodologies have been developed to identify enhancers and promoters, most have tacitly assumed that these elements are distinct.

Here we review these results, focusing on the factors that determine the promoter and/or enhancer activity of regulatory elements. We discuss emerging models that define regulatory elements by accessible DNA and their non-mutually-exclusive abilities to drive transcription initiation (promoter activity) and/or to enhance transcription at other such regions (enhancer activity).},

Our analysis detected EPIN clusters enriched with the architectural protein CTCF, a regulator of enhancer-promoter interactions. CTCF presence was coupled with the prevalence of prostate cancer (PrCa) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the same EPIN clusters, suggesting functional implications in PrCa. Within the EPINs displaying enrichments in both CTCF and PrCa SNPs, we also show enrichment in oncogenes. We substantiated our identified SNPs through CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and RNAi screens experiments.

Although the contribution of chromatin in DNA repair has been investigated1,2, the contribution of chromosome folding to these processes remains unclear3. Here we report that, after the production of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells, ATM drives the formation of a new chromatin compartment (D compartment) through the clustering of damaged topologically associating domains, decorated with {$\gamma$}H2AX and 53BP1. This compartment forms by a mechanism that is consistent with polymer{\textendash}polymer phase separation rather than liquid{\textendash}liquid phase separation. The D compartment arises mostly in G1 phase, is independent of cohesin and is enhanced after pharmacological inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) or R-loop accumulation. Importantly, R-loop-enriched DNA-damage-responsive genes physically localize to the D compartment, and this contributes to their optimal activation, providing a function for DSB clustering in the DNA damage response. However, DSB-induced chromosome reorganization comes at the expense of an increased rate of translocations, also observed in cancer genomes. Overall, we characterize how DSB-induced compartmentalization orchestrates the DNA damage response and highlight the critical impact of chromosome architecture in genomic instability.},

  abstract = {KSHV has a biphasic life cycle encompassing a latent state and lytic replication. The KSHV replication and transcription activator viral protein, encoded from open reading frame 50 (ORF50), is the key viral protein which drives the switch between the latent and lytic phases (Guito and Lukac, 2012). We have recently demonstrated that KSHV manipulates the host cell N6-methyl adenosine (m6A) RNA modification pathway to enhance viral gene expression. Specifically, we have shown that the KSHV ORF50 transcript is m6A methylated, allowing the recruitment of the m6A reader protein, Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1 (SND1), resulting in the stabilisation of the ORF50 transcript and efficient KSHV lytic replication (Baquero-Perez et al. 2019). Further analysis of the m6A modified site with the ORF50 transcript has identified an RNA stem-loop, termed ORF50-1, which is a m6A-modified 43-mer, essential for SND-1 binding, thought to occur in a secondary structure/ sequence-dependent manner. Generating in silico 3D structures of the ORF50-1 RNA in its native `N' and m6A-modified `M' form confirms that the presence of the m6A-modification has repercussions in the lower part of the stem-loop and predicts a different secondary structure(collab. Pasquale and Roeder). Due to the obvious structural differences anticipated, RNA-binding ligands have been identified using Small Molecule Microarrays (SMMS) (collab. Fullenkamp and Schneekloth). By investigating these ligands in biophysicalexperiments, we have verified RNA-binding and optimised cell-based assays to assess anti-viral properties. It is hoped these experiments will highlight the importance of A versus m6A within the lytic phase of KSHV's lifecycle.,},

This accuracy significantly and substantially exceeds what could be achieved by using DNA sequence as an input feature. Remarkably, we show that transcription factor binding enables strikingly accurate predictions across different cell lines. Analysis of the relative importance of specific transcription factors as predictors of specific histone marks recapitulated known interactions between transcription factors and histone modifiers. Our results demonstrate that reported associations between histone marks and gene expression may be indirect effects caused by interactions between transcription factors and histone-modifying complexes.},

By embedding data for epigenetic marks (H3K27ac), chromatin accessibility (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing [ATAC-seq]), and structural anchors (CCCTC-binding factor [CTCF]), we developed a highly predictive heteromorphic polymer (HiP-HoP) model, where the chromatin fiber varied along its length; combined with diffusing protein bridges and loop extrusion, this model predicted the 3D organization of genomic loci at a population and single-cell level. The model was validated at several gene loci, including the complex Pax6 gene, and was able to determine locus conformations across cell types with varying levels of transcriptional activity and explain different mechanisms of enhancer use. Minimal a priori knowledge of epigenetic marks is sufficient to recapitulate complex genomic loci in 3D and enable predictions of chromatin folding paths.},

The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly renewing mammalian tissue. Proliferative cells in crypts of Lieberk{\"u}hn sustain a stream of differentiated cells~that are continually shed into the lumen. We apply chromosome conformation capture combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) and sequencing to measure enhancer-promoter interactions in progenitor and differentiated cells of the intestinal epithelium. Despite dynamic gene regulation across the differentiation axis, we find that enhancer-promoter interactions are relatively stable. Functionally, we find HNF4 transcription factors are required for chromatin looping at target genes. Depletion of HNF4 disrupts local chromatin looping, histone modifications, and target gene expression.

  abstract = {Fibroblasts are found in abundance in the airway and distal lung. They orchestrate the continual production and turnover of the pulmonary extracellular matrix, the correct organization of which is vital for efficient gas exchange. The lung matrix also provides crucial structural support for various cells and exerts profound influences on their function. These interactions regulate normal airway and alveolar morphogenesis during fetal development, and regain prominence during repair responses following injury to these tissues. In addition to matrix formation, immune functions have also been ascribed to fibroblasts, including antigen presentation and the secretion of bioactive molecules. These roles highlight the versatility and indispensability of fibroblasts to the maintenance of normal lung physiology. Consequently, fibroblast dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disorders in which there is disproportionate extracellular matrix deposition (e.g., fibrotic lung diseases) or destruction (e.g., emphysematous and cystic lung disorders). In these settings, uncontrolled fibroblast activation and proliferation or, conversely, the loss of fibroblast number or function, contribute to the initiation and progression of abnormal lung repair. Substantial research efforts are being directed at identifying molecular targets and novel strategies to treat disorders characterized by pathological matrix remodeling.},

This produces unprecedented levels of sensitivity and reproducibility and can be used to analyse many genetic loci and samples simultaneously. Importantly, high-resolution data can be produced on as few as 100,000 cells and SNPs can be used to generate allele specific tracks. The method is straightforward to perform and should therefore greatly facilitate the task of linking SNPs identified by genome wide association studies with the genes they influence. The complete and detailed protocol presented here, with new publicly available tools for library design and data analysis, will allow most laboratories to analyse chromatin conformation at levels of sensitivity and throughput that were previously impossible.},

However, the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms driving the crosstalk between nuclear architecture and (epi)genomic information is still lacking. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a powerful model organism to address these questions owing to its compact genome for which we have a rich collection of microscopy, chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and ChIP-seq experiments. Using polymer modelling, we investigate the roles of nucleolus formation and epigenomics-driven interactions in shaping the 3D genome of A. thaliana. By validation of several predictions with published data, we demonstrate that self-attracting nucleolar organizing regions and repulsive constitutive heterochromatin are major mechanisms to regulate the organization of chromosomes. Simulations also suggest that interphase chromosomes maintain a partial structural memory of the V-shapes, typical of (sub)metacentric chromosomes in anaphase. Additionally, self-attraction between facultative heterochromatin regions facilitates the formation of Polycomb bodies hosting H3K27me3-enriched gene-clusters. Since nucleolus and heterochromatin are highly-conserved in eukaryotic cells, our findings pave the way for a comprehensive characterization of the generic principles that are likely to shape and regulate the 3D genome in many species.},

  abstract = {Single cells displaying many characteristics in common with smooth muscle are now being identified in many organs. Although their origin remains elusive, they are nonetheless known to play a major role in fibroproliferative diseases and stromal reactions by virtue of their contractile properties. We have investigated the contractile properties and expression of smooth muscle-associated proteins in such a cell line derived from human foetal lung (IMR-90). For almost two decades, these cells have served as model fibroblasts in a wide variety of studies. And yet, IMR-90 cells manifest many features characteristic of differentiated smooth muscle cells: they exhibit the same elongated, slender form and the strikingly regular, longitudinal alignment of their actin-attachment sites, which are indispensable for coordinated contraction. Moreover, these adhaerens junctions also contain metavinculin, the smooth muscle analogue of vinculin, the stable expression of which has not previously been demonstrated in cultured cells. Since sm 22, as well as the smooth muscle-associated {$\alpha$}-actin isoform and calponin are also expressed, IMR-90 cells must now be classified as myofibroblasts. When cultivated on a rubbery silicon surface, IMR-90 cells respond to stimulation with a rate of contraction which is considerably faster than that exhibited by fibroblasts derived from other established lines. Taken together, the regular longitudinal orientation of the adhaerens junctions, the stable expression of metavinculin, and the rapid speed of shortening in IMR-90 cells suggest, by implication, that the periodicity of actin attachment sites is a fundamental determinant of contractile efficiency in smooth muscle cells; this spacing may be mediated by metavinculin. {\copyright} 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

To explore TAD structure and function, we developed a polymer model that can extract the full repertoire of chromatin conformations within TADs from population-based 3C data. This model predicts actual physical distances and to what extent chromosomal contacts vary between cells. It also identifies interactions within single TADs that stabilize boundaries between TADs and allows us to identify and genetically validate key structural elements within TADs. Combining the model's predictions with high-resolution DNA FISH and quantitative RNA FISH for TADs within the X-inactivation center (Xic), we dissect the relationship between transcription and spatial proximity to cis-regulatory elements. We demonstrate that contacts between potential regulatory elements occur in the context of fluctuating structures rather than stable loops and propose that such fluctuations may contribute to asymmetric expression in the Xic during X inactivation.},

Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn the cis-regulatory grammars encoded in regulatory DNA sequences associated with transcription factor binding and chromatin accessibility. Several feature attribution methods have been developed for estimating the predictive importance of individual features (nucleotides or motifs) in any input DNA sequence to its associated output prediction from a DNN model. However, these methods do not reveal higher-order feature interactions encoded by the models.We present a new method called Deep Feature Interaction Maps (DFIM) to efficiently estimate interactions between all pairs of features in any input DNA sequence. DFIM accurately identifies ground truth motif interactions embedded in simulated regulatory DNA sequences. DFIM identifies synergistic interactions between GATA1 and TAL1 motifs from in~vivo TF binding models. DFIM reveals epistatic interactions involving nucleotides flanking the core motif of the Cbf1 TF in yeast from in~vitro TF binding models. We also apply DFIM to regulatory sequence models of in~vivo chromatin accessibility to reveal interactions between regulatory genetic variants and proximal motifs of target TFs as validated by TF binding quantitative trait loci. Our approach makes significant strides in improving the interpretability of deep learning models for genomics.Code is available at: https://github.com/kundajelab/dfim.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Nuclear compartments are prominent features of 3D chromatin organization, but sequencing depth limitations have impeded investigation at ultra fine-scale. CTCF loops are generally studied at a finer scale, but the impact of looping on proximal interactions remains enigmatic. Here, we critically examine nuclear compartments and CTCF loop-proximal interactions using a combination of in situ Hi-C at unparalleled depth, algorithm development, and biophysical modeling. Producing a large Hi-C map with 33 billion contacts in conjunction with an algorithm for performing principal component analysis on sparse, super massive matrices~(POSSUMM), we resolve compartments to 500\,bp. Our results demonstrate that essentially all active promoters and distal enhancers localize in the A compartment, even when flanking sequences do not. Furthermore, we find that the TSS and TTS of paused genes are often segregated into separate compartments. We then identify diffuse interactions that radiate from CTCF loop anchors, which correlate with strong enhancer-promoter interactions and proximal transcription. We also find that these diffuse interactions depend on CTCF's RNA binding domains. In this work, we demonstrate features of fine-scale chromatin organization consistent with a revised model in which compartments are more precise than commonly thought while CTCF loops are more protracted.},

Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) has become a powerful, routinely applied tool to analyze the genome architecture specifically on the micro-scale. A plethora of well characterized FISH probes (e.g., DNA, PNA) are commercially available which are specific for gene targets, centromeres, telomeres, whole chromosome territories and sub-chromosomal domains. Together with standardized protocols these probes are delivered as ready-to-use kits for fluorescence microscopy of 3D conserved cell nuclei in biological research as well as for clinical diagnostics. In this article, some developments of FISH are reviewed and characteristic steps of the procedure are described. Examples are presented. With the development of super-resolution microscopy for nano-scale investigations, requirements for nano-FISH probes promoted the development of oligonucleotide based FISH techniques as for instance COMBinatorial Oligo FISH (COMBO-FISH). The development of COMBO-FISH is also reviewed especially with respect to low temperature approaches that allow the combination of COMBO-FISH with other epigenetic techniques like immunostaining with specific antibodies. Examples are presented for analyses by super-resolution single molecule localization microscopy.},

Regulation of transcription is a fundamental cellular process where the mechanisms involved in initiation have been studied extensively, but those involved in arresting the process are poorly understood. Modeling of the potential roles of RNA in transcriptional control suggested a non-equilibrium feedback control mechanism where low levels of RNA promote condensates formed by electrostatic interactions whereas relatively high levels promote dissolution of these condensates. Evidence from in~vitro and in~vivo experiments support a model where RNAs produced during early steps in transcription initiation stimulate condensate formation, whereas the burst of RNAs produced during elongation stimulate condensate dissolution. We propose that transcriptional regulation incorporates a feedback mechanism whereby transcribed RNAs initially stimulate but then ultimately arrest the process.},

To address this conundrum, we used high-resolution Micro-C and nascent transcript profiling in mouse embryonic stem cells. We find that enhancer{\textendash}promoter (E{\textendash}P) interactions are largely insensitive to acute (3-h) depletion of CTCF, cohesin or WAPL. YY1 has been proposed as a structural regulator of E{\textendash}P loops, but acute YY1 depletion also had minimal effects on E{\textendash}P loops, transcription and 3D genome folding. Strikingly, live-cell, single-molecule imaging revealed that cohesin depletion reduced transcription factor (TF) binding to chromatin. Thus, although CTCF, cohesin, WAPL or YY1 is not required for the short-term maintenance of most E{\textendash}P interactions and gene expression, our results suggest that cohesin may facilitate TFs to search for and bind their targets more efficiently.},

Here, we overcome some limitations of conventional 3C-based methods by using high-resolution Micro-C to probe links between 3D genome organization and transcriptional regulation in mouse stem cells. Combinatorial binding of transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin modifiers spatially segregates TAD regions into various finer-scale structures with distinct regulatory features including stripes, dots, and domains linking promoters-to-promoters (P-P) or enhancers-to-promoters (E-P), and bundle contacts between Polycomb regions. E-P stripes extending from the edge of domains predominantly link co-expressed loci, often in the absence of CTCF and cohesin occupancy. Acute inhibition of transcription disrupts these gene-related folding features without altering higher-order chromatin structures. Our study uncovers previously obscured finer-scale genome organization, establishing functional links between chromatin folding and gene regulation., Hsieh et al. describe chromatin folding at single-nucleosome resolution in mammalian cells using Micro-C, an enhanced chromosome conformation capture method.

Interactions emanating from IKAROS-bound enhancers override CTCF-imposed boundaries to assemble lineage-specific regulatory units built on a backbone of smaller invariant topological domains. Gain of function in epithelial cells confirms IKAROS' ability to reconfigure chromatin architecture at multiple scales.

This can be overcome to some extent by establishing lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) by infecting peripheral blood lymphocytes with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) which is known to immortalize human resting B cells in vitro giving rise to actively proliferating B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. The present study involves preparation and characterization of LCLs generated from patients with multiple primary neoplasms (MPN) of upper aero-digestive tract (UADT). Thirty seven LCLs were established from UADT MPN patients and healthy age, sex and habit matched controls using EBV crude stock. Characterization was done with respect to expression of CD-19 (Pan B-cell marker), CD3 (T cell specific marker), CD56 (NK-cell specific marker), cell morphology, ploidy analysis, genotype and gene expression comparison with the parent lymphocytes. LCLs showed rosette morphology with doubling time of approximately 24 h. Ploidy analysis showed diploid DNA content which was maintained for at least 30 population doublings. When compared with parent lymphocytes there appeared no change at genetic and gene expression level. Our results show that lymphoblastoid cell lines are a good surrogate of isolated lymphocytes bearing their close resemblance at genetic and phenotypic level to parent lymphocytes and are a valuable resource for understanding genotype-phenotype interactions.},

This provides a detailed description of both intra- and inter-chromosomal arrangements. Chromosomal intermingling is an important driver for radiation-induced DNA mis-repair. Which is a key biological endpoint of relevance to the fields of cancer therapy (radiotherapy), public health (biodosimetry) and space travel. For the first time, we leverage these methods of inferring genome organisation and couple them to nano-dosimetric radiation track structure modelling to predict quantities and distribution of DNA damage within cell-type specific geometries. These nano-dosimetric simulations are highly dependent on geometry and are benefited from the inclusion of experimentally driven chromosome conformations. We show how the changes in Hi-C contract maps impact the inferred geometries resulting in significant differences in chromosomal intermingling. We demonstrate how these differences propagate through to significant changes in the distribution of DNA damage throughout the cell nucleus, suggesting implications for DNA repair fidelity and subsequent cell fate. We suggest that differences in the geometric clustering for the chromosomes between the cell-types are a plausible factor leading to changes in cellular radiosensitivity. Furthermore, we investigate changes in cell shape, such as flattening, and show that this greatly impacts the distribution of DNA damage. This should be considered when comparing in vitro results to in vivo systems. The effect may be especially important when attempting to translate radiosensitivity measurements at the experimental in vitro level to the patient or human level.},

Here, we characterized fibroblast focus morphology and interrelationships in 3D using an integrated micro-CT and histological methodology. In 3D, fibroblast foci were morphologically complex structures, with large variations in shape and volume (range, 1.3 {\texttimes} 104 to 9.9 {\texttimes} 107 {$\mu$}m3). Within each tissue sample numerous multiform foci were present, ranging from a minimum of 0.9 per mm3 of lung tissue to a maximum of 11.1 per mm3 of lung tissue. Each focus was an independent structure, and no interconnections were observed. Together, our data indicate that in 3D fibroblast foci form a constellation of heterogeneous structures with large variations in shape and volume, suggesting previously unrecognized plasticity. No evidence of interconnectivity was identified, consistent with the concept that foci represent discrete sites of lung injury and repair.},

We compute size distributions of chromatin beads for different coarse-graining scales, quantify fluctuations and distributions of bond lengths between neighboring regions, and derive effective spring constant values. Unlike the prevalent notion, our findings argue that coarse-grained chromatin beads must be considered as soft particles that can overlap, and we derive an effective inter-bead soft potential and quantify an overlap parameter. We also compute angle distributions giving insights into intrinsic folding and local bendability of chromatin. While the nucleosome-linker DNA bond angle naturally emerges from our work, we show two populations of local structural states. The bead sizes, bond lengths, and bond angles show different mean behavior at Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) boundaries and TAD interiors. We integrate our findings into a coarse-grained polymer model and provide quantitative estimates of all model parameters, which can serve as a foundational basis for all future coarse-grained chromatin simulations.},

  abstract = {Many chromatin features play critical roles in regulating gene expression. A complete understanding of gene regulation will require the mapping of specific chromatin features in small samples of cells at high resolution. Here we describe Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT\&Tag), an enzyme-tethering strategy that provides efficient high-resolution sequencing libraries for profiling diverse chromatin components. In CUT\&Tag, a chromatin protein is bound in situ by a specific antibody, which then tethers a protein A-Tn5 transposase fusion protein. Activation of the transposase efficiently generates fragment libraries with high resolution and exceptionally low background. All steps from live cells to sequencing-ready libraries can be performed in a single tube on the benchtop or a microwell in a high-throughput pipeline, and the entire procedure can be performed in one day. We demonstrate the utility of CUT\&Tag by profiling histone modifications, RNA Polymerase II and transcription factors on low cell numbers and single cells.},

To fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. Using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. We compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. We also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.},

LAMPS-induced condensation at enhancers and promoters activates endogenous gene transcription by chromatin reconfiguration, causing increased chromatin accessibility and de novo formation of long-range chromosomal loops. Proteomic profiling of light-induced condensates by dCas9-mediated affinity purification uncovers multivalent interaction-dependent remodeling of macromolecular composition, resulting in the selective enrichment of transcriptional coactivators and chromatin structure proteins. Our findings support a model whereby the formation of nuclear condensates at native genomic loci reconfigures chromatin architecture and multiprotein assemblies to modulate gene transcription. Hence, LAMPS facilitates mechanistic interrogation of the relationship between nuclear condensation, genome structure, and gene transcription in living cells.},

Current models suggest that enhancers act as computational devices, receiving multiple inputs from activators and repressors and resolving them into a single positive or a negative signal that is transmitted to the basal transcriptional machinery. We show that a simple, compact enhancer is capable of representing both repressed and activated states at the same time and in the same nucleus. This finding suggests that closely apposed factor binding sites, situated within compact cis-elements, can be independently interpreted by the transcriptional machinery, possibly through successive enhancer-promoter interactions. These results provide clear evidence that the computational functions usually ascribed to the enhancer itself are actually shared with the basal machinery. In contrast to the autonomous computer model of enhancer function, an information-display or `billboard' model of enhancer activity may better describe many developmentally regulated transcriptional enhancers.},

These interactions further aggregated into higher-order clusters, wherein proximal and distal genes were engaged through promoter-promoter interactions. Most genes with promoter-promoter interactions were active and transcribed cooperatively, and some interacting promoters could influence each other implying combinatorial complexity of transcriptional controls. Comparative analyses of different cell lines showed that cell-specific chromatin interactions could provide structural frameworks for cell-specific transcription, and suggested significant enrichment of enhancer-promoter interactions for cell-specific functions. Furthermore, genetically-identified disease-associated non-coding elements were found to be spatially engaged with corresponding genes through long-range interactions.

Here, we revealed the relationship by first illustrating distinct profile patterns of chromatin features related to different binding events, including single TF binding and TF{\textendash}TF co-occupancy of 71 TFs from five human cell lines. We further implemented statistical analyses to demonstrate the relationship by accurately predicting co-occupancy genome-widely using chromatin features including DNase I hypersensitivity, 11 histone modifications (HMs) and GC content. Remarkably, our results showed that the combination of chromatin features enables accurate predictions across the five cells. For individual chromatin features, DNase I enables high and consistent predictions. H3K27ac, H3K4me 2, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac are more reliable predictors than other HMs. Although the combination of 11 HMs achieves accurate predictions, their predictive ability varies considerably when a model obtained from one cell is applied to others, indicating relationship between HMs and TF{\textendash}TF co-occupancy is cell type dependent.

While the molecular mechanisms of rRNA transcription regulation have been elucidated in great detail, the functional organization of the multicopy rRNA gene clusters (rDNA) in the nucleolus is less well understood. Here we apply super-resolution 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to investigate the spatial organization of transcriptionally competent active rDNA chromatin at size scales well below the diffraction limit by optical microscopy. We identify active rDNA chromatin units exhibiting uniformly ring-shaped conformations with diameters of {\textasciitilde}240\,nm in mouse and {\textasciitilde}170\,nm in human fibroblasts, consistent with rDNA looping. The active rDNA chromatin units are clearly separated from each other and from the surrounding areas of rRNA processing. Simultaneous imaging of all active genes bound by Pol I and the architectural chromatin protein Upstream Binding Transcription Factor (UBF) reveals a random spatial orientation of regular repeats of rDNA coding sequences within the nucleoli. These observations imply rDNA looping and exclude potential formation of systematic spatial assemblies of the well-ordered repetitive arrays of transcription units. Collectively, this study uncovers key features of the 3D organization of active rDNA chromatin units and their nucleolar clusters providing a spatial framework of nucleolar chromatin organization at unprecedented detail.},

  abstract = {In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), developmental gene promoters are characterized by their bivalent chromatin state, with simultaneous modification by MLL2 and Polycomb complexes. Although essential for embryogenesis, bivalency is functionally not well understood. Here, we show that MLL2 plays a central role in ESC genome organization. We generate a catalog of bona fide bivalent genes in ESCs and demonstrate that loss of MLL2 leads to increased Polycomb occupancy. Consequently, promoters lose accessibility, long-range interactions are redistributed, and ESCs fail to differentiate. We pose that bivalency balances accessibility and long-range connectivity of promoters, allowing developmental gene expression to be properly modulated.},

  abstract = {Genetic studies promise to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes (T2D). Variants associated with T2D are often located in tissue-specific enhancer clusters or super-enhancers. So far, such domains have been defined through clustering of enhancers in linear genome maps rather than in three-dimensional (3D) space. Furthermore, their target genes are often unknown. We have created promoter capture Hi-C maps in human pancreatic islets. This linked diabetes-associated enhancers to their target genes, often located hundreds of kilobases away. It also revealed {$>$}1,300 groups of islet enhancers, super-enhancers and active promoters that form 3D hubs, some of which show coordinated glucose-dependent activity. We demonstrate that genetic variation in hubs impacts insulin secretion heritability, and show that hub annotations can be used for polygenic scores that predict T2D risk driven by islet regulatory variants. Human islet 3D chromatin architecture, therefore, provides a framework for interpretation of T2D genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals.},

In contrast, in higher organisms that have larger genomes, TFs recognize sequences that are too short to define unique genomic positions. In addition, development of multicellular organisms requires molecular systems that are capable of executing combinatorial logical operations. Co-operative recognition of DNA by multiple TFs allows both definition of unique genomic positions in large genomes, and complex information processing at the level of individual regulatory elements. The TFs can co-operate in multiple different ways, and the precise mechanism used for co-operation determines important features of the regulatory interactions. Here, we present an overview of the structural basis of the different mechanisms by which TFs can cooperate, focusing on insight from recent functional studies and structural analyses of specific TF-TF-DNA complexes.},

Focusing on chromosomal regions that contribute to compartments, we discover distinct structures that, in spite of considerable variability, can predict whether such regions correspond to active (A-type) or inactive (B-type) compartments.

The canonical TF accomplishes this with two domains, one that binds specific DNA sequences and the other that binds protein coactivators or corepressors. We find that at least half of TFs also bind RNA, doing so through a previously unrecognized domain with sequence and functional features analogous to the arginine-rich motif of the HIV transcriptional activator Tat. RNA binding contributes to TF function by promoting the dynamic association between DNA, RNA, and TF on chromatin. TF-RNA interactions are a conserved feature important for vertebrate development and disrupted in disease. We propose that the ability to bind DNA, RNA, and protein is a general property of many TFs and is fundamental to their gene regulatory function.},

To visualize chromatin in situ, we identified a fluorescent dye that stains DNA with an osmiophilic polymer and selectively enhances its contrast in EM. Using ChromEMT (ChromEM tomography), we reveal the ultrastructure and three-dimensional (3D) organization of individual chromatin polymers, megabase domains, and mitotic chromosomes. We show that chromatin is a disordered 5- to 24-nanometer-diameter curvilinear chain that is packed together at different 3D concentration distributions in interphase and mitosis. Chromatin chains have many different particle arrangements and bend at various lengths to achieve structural compaction and high packing densities.},

DNA is wrapped around a globular complex of 8 core histone proteins, two of each histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. This nucleosomal arrangement is the context in which information can be established along the sequence of the DNA for regulating different aspects of the chromosome, including transcription, DNA replication and repair processes, recombination, kinetochore function, and telomere function. Posttranslational modifications of histone proteins and modifications of DNA bases underlie chromatin-based epigenetic regulation. Enzymes that catalyze histone modifications are considered writers. Conceptually, erasers remove these modifications, and readers are proteins binding these modifications and can target specific functions. On a larger scale, the 3-dimensional (3D) organization of chromatin in the nucleus also contributes to gene regulation. Whereas chromosomes are condensed during mitosis and segregated during cell division, they occupy discrete volumes called chromosome territories during interphase. Looping or folding of DNA can bring regulatory elements including enhancers close to gene promoters. Recent techniques facilitate understanding of 3D contacts at high resolution. Lastly, chromatin is dynamic and changes in histone occupancy, histone modifications, and accessibility of DNA contribute to epigenetic regulation.},

PNA oligonucleotides have excellent penetration properties due to their small size (typically 15 to 18-mers) and can be directly labeled with fluorochromes. These properties have been exploited to develop quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) onto denatured single-stranded chromosomal DNA target sequences. The latter can be present in preparations of fixed metaphase cells on slides (Q-FISH) or in heat-treated (interphase) cells in suspension (flow-FISH).},

  abstract = {Nucleosomes cluster together when chromatin folds in the cell to form heterogeneous groups termed "clutches". These structural units add another level of chromatin regulation, for example during cell differentiation. Yet, the mechanisms that regulate their size and compaction remain obscure. Here, using our chromatin mesoscale model, we dissect clutch patterns in fibers with different combinations of nucleosome positions, linker histone density, and acetylation levels to investigate their role in clutch regulation. First, we isolate the effect of each chromatin parameter by studying systems with regular nucleosome spacing; second, we design systems with naturally-occurring linker lengths that fold onto specific clutch patterns; third, we model gene-encoding fibers to understand how these combined factors contribute to gene structure. Our results show how these chromatin parameters act together to produce different-sized nucleosome clutches. The length of nucleosome free regions (NFRs) profoundly affects clutch size, while the length of linker DNA has a moderate effect. In general, higher linker histone densities produce larger clutches by a chromatin compaction mechanism, while higher acetylation levels produce smaller clutches by a chromatin unfolding mechanism. We also show that it is possible to design fibers with naturally-occurring DNA linkers and NFRs that fold onto specific clutch patterns. Finally, in gene-encoding systems, a complex combination of variables dictates a gene-specific clutch pattern. Together, these results shed light into the mechanisms that regulate nucleosome clutches and suggest a new epigenetic mechanism by which chromatin parameters regulate transcriptional activity via the three-dimensional folded state of the genome at a nucleosome level.},

Q-FISH is most commonly used to study telomere length, which in vertebrates are repetitive hexameric sequences (TTAGGG) located at the distal end of chromosomes. Telomeres are necessary at chromosome ends to prevent DNA-damage responses as well as genome instability. To this day, the Q-FISH method continues to be utilized in the field of telomere research.},

The use of these techniques provides complementary information on average spatial distances (FISH) and contact probabilities (3C) for specific genomic sites. To infer the structure of the chromatin fiber or to distinguish functional interactions from random colocalization, it is useful to compare experimental data to predictions from statistical fiber models. The current estimates of the fiber stiffness derived from FISH and 3C differ by a factor of 5. They are based on the wormlike chain model and a heuristic modification of the Shimada-Yamakawa theory of looping for unkinkable, unconstrained, zero-diameter filaments. Here, we provide an extended theoretical and computational framework to explain the currently available experimental data for various species on the basis of a unique, minimal model of decondensing chromosomes: a kinkable, topologically constraint, semiflexible polymer with the (FISH) Kuhn length of lK = 300 nm, 10 kinks per Mbp, and a contact distance of 45 nm. In particular: 1), we reconsider looping of finite-diameter filaments on the basis of an analytical approximation (novel, to our knowledge) of the wormlike chain radial density and show that unphysically large contact radii would be required to explain the 3C data based on the FISH estimate of the fiber stiffness; 2),~we demonstrate that the observed interaction frequencies at short genomic lengths can be explained by the presence of a low concentration of curvature defects (kinks); and 3), we show that the most recent experimental 3C data for human chromosomes are in quantitative agreement with interaction frequencies extracted from our simulations of topologically confined model chromosomes.},

In particular, we show that the experimentally observed territory shapes and spatial distances between marked chromosome sites for human, Drosophila, and budding yeast chromosomes can be reproduced by a parameter-free minimal model of decondensing chromosomes. Our results suggest that the observed interphase structure and dynamics are due to generic polymer effects: confined Brownian motion conserving the local topological state of long chain molecules and segregation of mutually unentangled chains due to topological constraints.},

However, despite recent efforts, direct visualization and quantification of this process in single cells remains an open challenge. Here, we use polymer simulations and dedicated analysis methods to explore if, and under which conditions, DNA loop extrusion can be detected and quantitatively characterized by imaging pairs of fluorescently labeled loci located near loop or TAD anchors in fixed or living cells. We find that under realistic conditions, extrusion can be detected and the frequency of loop formation can be quantified from fixed cell images alone, while the lifetime of loops and the speed of extrusion can be estimated from dynamic live-cell data. Our delineation of appropriate imaging conditions and the proposed analytical methods lay the groundwork for a systematic quantitative characterization of loop extrusion in fixed or living cells.},

Two classes of transcription factors have been implicated in this process: the REL-containing proteins, Dorsal, Dif, and Relish, and the GATA factor Serpent. Here we present evidence that REL-GATA synergy plays a pervasive role in the immune response. SELEX assays identified consensus binding sites that permitted the characterization of several immunity regulatory DNAs. The distribution of REL and GATA sites within these DNAs suggests that most or all fat-specific immunity genes contain a common organization of regulatory elements: closely linked REL and GATA binding sites positioned in the same orientation and located near the transcription start site. Aspects of this "regulatory code" are essential for the immune response. These results suggest that immunity regulatory DNAs contain constrained organizational features, which may be a general property of eukaryotic enhancers.},

Here we combine modeling and real-time motion tracking experiments to infer the physical parameters describing chromatin fibers. In vitro, motion of nucleosome arrays can be accurately modeled by assuming a Kuhn length of 35-55 nm. In vivo, the amplitude of chromosome fluctuations is drastically reduced, and depends on transcription. Transcription activation increases chromatin dynamics only if it involves gene relocalization, while global transcriptional inhibition augments the fluctuations, yet without relocalization. Chromatin fiber motion is accounted for by a model of equilibrium fluctuations of a polymer chain, in which random contacts along the chromosome contour induce an excess of internal friction. Simulations that reproduce chromosome conformation capture and imaging data corroborate this hypothesis. This model unravels the transient nature of chromosome contacts, characterized by a life time of {$\sim$}2 seconds and a free energy of formation of {$\sim$}1 kBT.},

Such priming is accompanied by increased chromatin accessibility, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we analyze the effect of Zld on genome-wide nucleosome occupancy and binding of the patterning TF Dorsal (Dl). Our results show that early enhancers are characterized by an intrinsically high nucleosome barrier. Zld tackles this nucleosome barrier through local depletion of nucleosomes with the effect being dependent on the number and position of Zld motifs. Without Zld, Dl binding decreases at enhancers and redistributes to open regions devoid of enhancer activity. We propose that Zld primes enhancers by lowering the high nucleosome barrier just enough to assist TFs in accessing their binding motifs and promoting spatially controlled enhancer activation if the right patterning TFs are present. We envision that genome activators in general will utilize this mechanism to activate the zygotic genome in a robust and precise manner.},

ATAC-seq technology effectively identifies active cis-REs in a given cell type (including from single cells) by mapping accessible chromatin at base-pair resolution. However, these maps are not immediately useful for inferring specific functions of cis-REs. For this purpose, we developed a deep learning framework (CoRE-ATAC) with novel data encoders that integrate DNA sequence (reference or personal genotypes) with ATAC-seq cut sites and read pileups. CoRE-ATAC was trained on 4 cell types (n = 6 samples/replicates) and accurately predicted known cis-RE functions from 7 cell types (n = 40 samples) that were not used in model training (mean average precision = 0.80, mean F1 score = 0.70). CoRE-ATAC enhancer predictions from 19 human islet samples coincided with genetically modulated gain/loss of enhancer activity, which was confirmed by massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). Finally, CoRE-ATAC effectively inferred cis-RE function from aggregate single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC) data from human blood-derived immune cells that overlapped with known functional annotations in sorted immune cells, which established the efficacy of these models to study cis-RE functions of rare cells without the need for cell sorting. ATAC-seq maps from primary human cells reveal individual- and cell-specific variation in cis-RE activity. CoRE-ATAC increases the functional resolution of these maps, a critical step for studying regulatory disruptions behind diseases.},

We previously developed a reconstruction method to resolve the 3D architecture of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes using 3C-based data. These models were congruent with fluorescent imaging validation. However, the limits of such methods have not systematically been assessed. Here we propose the first evaluation of a mean-field restraint-based reconstruction of genomes by considering diverse chromosome architectures and different levels of data noise and structural variability. The results show that: first, current scoring functions for 3D reconstruction correlate with the accuracy of the models; second, reconstructed models are robust to noise but sensitive to structural variability; third, the local structure organization of genomes, such as Topologically Associating Domains, results in more accurate models; fourth, to a certain extent, the models capture the intrinsic structural variability in the input matrices and fifth, the accuracy of the models can be a priori predicted by analyzing the properties of the interaction matrices. In summary, our work provides a systematic analysis of the limitations of a mean-field restrain-based method, which could be taken into consideration in further development of methods as well as their applications.},

  abstract = {Protein structures can provide invaluable information, both for reasoning about biological processes and for enabling interventions such as structure-based drug development or targeted mutagenesis. After decades of effort, 17\% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure1. Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold2, at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool~that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},

  abstract = {Current theories on the conformation and dynamics of unknotted and non-concatenated ring polymers in melt conditions describe each ring as a tree-like double-folded object. While evidence from simulations supports this picture on a single ring level, other works show pairs of rings also thread each other, a feature overlooked in the tree theories. Here we reconcile this dichotomy using Monte Carlo simulations of the ring melts with different bending rigidities. We find that rings are double-folded (more strongly for stiffer rings) on and above the entanglement length scale, while the threadings are localized on smaller scales. The different theories disagree on the details of the tree structure, i.e., the fractal dimension of the backbone of the tree. In the stiffer melts we find an indication of a self-avoiding scaling of the backbone, while more flexible chains do not exhibit such a regime. Moreover, the theories commonly neglect threadings and assign different importance to the impact of the progressive constraint release (tube dilation) on single ring relaxation due to the motion of other rings. Despite that each threading creates only a small opening in the double-folded structure, the threading loops can be numerous and their length can exceed substantially the entanglement scale. We link the threading constraints to the divergence of the relaxation time of a ring, if the tube dilation is hindered by pinning a fraction of other rings in space. Current theories do not predict such divergence and predict faster than measured diffusion of rings, pointing at the relevance of the threading constraints in unpinned systems as well. Revision of the theories with explicit threading constraints might elucidate the validity of the conjectured existence of topological glass.},

The three subsets retained differences in cell size for up to 15 days of primary culture. Flow cytometric (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) measurements of forward-angle light scatter agreed well with fibroblast volume measured by image analysis and confirmed the utility of forward-angle light scatter for discriminating size subpopulations. Group II fibroblasts accumulated most rapidly by 8 days of culture and also contained the greatest proportion of S and G2/M phase cells as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Fibroblasts that were immunoreactive with antibodies to {$\alpha$}-smooth muscle actin ({$\alpha$}-SMA) were found only in group III. In situ end labeling of fragmented DNA detected apoptotic cells in bothgroups II andIII, but double labeling for in situ end labeling and {$\alpha$}-SMA revealed apoptotic cells in both the {$\alpha$}-SMA-positive and -negative populations. These results demonstrate that primary human lung fibroblasts behave as predicted by classic models of cell cycle progression and differentiation. However, they do not support the hypothesis that the expression of {$\alpha$}-actin is related to apoptosis. We also describe a simple and reproducible method for the high-yield isolation of human lung fibroblast subsets of differing proliferative potential and phenotype.},

Recent genomics and imaging technologies have revealed highly complex enhancer-promoter interaction networks, whereas advanced functional studies have started interrogating the forces behind the physical and functional communication among multiple enhancers and promoters. In this review, we first summarize our current understanding of the factors involved in enhancer-promoter communication, with a particular focus on recent papers that have revealed new layers of complexities to old questions. In the second part of the review, we focus on a subset of highly connected enhancer-promoter ``hubs'' and discuss their potential functions in signal integration and gene regulation, as well as the putative factors that might determine their dynamics and assembly.},

However, current methods for assessing Hi-C data reproducibility can produce misleading results because they ignore spatial features in Hi-C data, such as domain structure and distance dependence. We present HiCRep, a framework for assessing the reproducibility of Hi-C data that systematically accounts for these features. In particular, we introduce a novel similarity measure, the stratum adjusted correlation coefficient (SCC), for quantifying the similarity between Hi-C interaction matrices. Not only does it provide a statistically sound and reliable evaluation of reproducibility, SCC can also be used to quantify differences between Hi-C contact matrices and to determine the optimal sequencing depth for a desired resolution. The measure consistently shows higher accuracy than existing approaches in distinguishing subtle differences in reproducibility and depicting interrelationships of cell lineages. The proposed measure is straightforward to interpret and easy to compute, making it well-suited for providing standardized, interpretable, automatable, and scalable quality control. The freely available R package HiCRep implements our approach.},

Here, we demonstrate that population-based modeling{\textemdash}from ensemble Hi-C data{\textemdash}provides a detailed description of the nuclear microenvironment of genes and its role in gene function. We define the microenvironment by the subnuclear positions of genomic regions with respect to nuclear bodies, local chromatin compaction, and preferences in chromatin compartmentalization. These structural descriptors are determined in single-cell models, thereby revealing the structural variability between cells. We demonstrate that the microenvironment of a genomic region is linked to its functional potential in gene transcription, replication, and chromatin compartmentalization. Some chromatin regions feature a strong preference for a single microenvironment, due to association with specific nuclear bodies in most cells. Other chromatin shows high structural variability, which is a strong indicator of functional heterogeneity. Moreover, we identify specialized nuclear microenvironments, which distinguish chromatin in different functional states and reveal a key role of nuclear speckles in chromosome organization. We demonstrate that our method produces highly predictive three-dimensional genome structures, which accurately reproduce data from a variety of orthogonal experiments, thus considerably expanding the range of Hi-C data analysis.},

Here, by combining chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP{\textendash}seq), 3D DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (3D DNA FISH) and polymer simulations, we show that heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) is essential for de novo 3D genome organization during Drosophila early development. The binding of HP1a at pericentromeric heterochromatin is required to establish clustering of pericentromeric regions. Moreover, HP1a binding within chromosome arms is responsible for overall chromosome folding and has an important role in the formation of B-compartment regions. However, depletion of HP1a does not affect the A-compartment, which suggests that a different molecular mechanism segregates active chromosome regions. Our work identifies HP1a as an epigenetic regulator that is involved in establishing the global structure of the genome in the early embryo.},

The comprehensive elucidation of Drosophila gene networks provides an unprecedented opportunity to apply quantitative models to metazoan enhancers that govern complex patterns of gene expression during development. Models based on the fractional occupancy of defined DNA binding sites have been used to describe the regulation of the lac operon in E. coli and the lysis/lysogeny switch of phage lambda. Here, we apply similar models to enhancers regulated by the Dorsal gradient in the ventral neurogenic ectoderm (vNE) of the early Drosophila embryo. Quantitative models based on the fractional occupancy of Dorsal, Twist, and Snail binding sites raise the possibility that cooperative interactions among these regulatory proteins mediate subtle differences in the vNE expression patterns. Variations in cooperativity may be attributed to differences in the detailed linkage of Dorsal, Twist, and Snail binding sites in vNE enhancers. We propose that binding site occupancy is the key rate-limiting step for establishing localized patterns of gene expression in the early Drosophila embryo.},
