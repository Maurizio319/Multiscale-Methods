Nearly half of the DNA (48\%) does not match any known organism; identified organisms spanned 1,688 bacterial, viral, archaeal, and eukaryotic taxa, which were enriched for harmless genera associated with skin (e.g., Acinetobacter). Predicted ancestry of human DNA left on subway surfaces can recapitulate U.S. Census demographic data, and bacterial signatures can reveal a station's history, such as marine-associated bacteria in a hurricane-flooded station. Some evidence of pathogens was found (Bacillus anthracis), but a lack of reported cases in NYC suggests that the pathogens represent a normal, urban microbiome. This baseline metagenomic map of NYC could help long-term disease surveillance, bioterrorism threat mitigation, and health management in the built environment of cities.},

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSIBLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

Here we review these results, focusing on the factors that determine the promoter and/or enhancer activity of regulatory elements. We discuss emerging models that define regulatory elements by accessible DNA and their non-mutually-exclusive abilities to drive transcription initiation (promoter activity) and/or to enhance transcription at other such regions (enhancer activity).},

We introduce a deep learning model, BPNet, that uses DNA sequence to predict base-resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–nexus binding profiles of pluripotency TFs. We develop interpretation tools to learn predictive motif representations and identify soft syntax rules for cooperative TF binding interactions. Strikingly, Nanog preferentially binds with helical periodicity, and TFs often cooperate in a directional manner, which we validate using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-induced point mutations.

  abstract = {KSHV has a biphasic life cycle encompassing a latent state and lytic replication. The KSHV replication and transcription activator viral protein, encoded from open reading frame 50 (ORF50), is the key viral protein which drives the switch between the latent and lytic phases (Guito and Lukac, 2012). We have recently demonstrated that KSHV manipulates the host cell N6-methyl adenosine (m6A) RNA modification pathway to enhance viral gene expression. Specifically, we have shown that the KSHV ORF50 transcript is m6A methylated, allowing the recruitment of the m6A reader protein, Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1 (SND1), resulting in the stabilisation of the ORF50 transcript and efficient KSHV lytic replication (Baquero-Perez et al. 2019). Further analysis of the m6A modified site with the ORF50 transcript has identified an RNA stem-loop, termed ORF50-1, which is a m6A-modified 43-mer, essential for SND-1 binding, thought to occur in a secondary structure/ sequence-dependent manner. Generating in silico 3D structures of the ORF50-1 RNA in its native ‘N’ and m6A-modified ‘M’ form confirms that the presence of the m6A-modification has repercussions in the lower part of the stem-loop and predicts a different secondary structure(collab. Pasquale and Roeder). Due to the obvious structural differences anticipated, RNA-binding ligands have been identified using Small Molecule Microarrays (SMMS) (collab. Fullenkamp and Schneekloth). By investigating these ligands in biophysicalexperiments, we have verified RNA-binding and optimised cell-based assays to assess anti-viral properties. It is hoped these experiments will highlight the importance of A versus m6A within the lytic phase of KSHV’s lifecycle.,},

  abstract = {The loss of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal system underlies the onset of the typical motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Lewy bodies (LB) and Lewy neurites (LN), proteinaceous inclusions mainly composed of insoluble α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils are key neuropathological hallmarks of the brain of affected patients. Compelling evidence supports that in the early prodromal phases of PD, synaptic terminal and axonal alterations initiate and drive a retrograde degeneration process culminating with the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. This notwithstanding, the molecular triggers remain to be fully elucidated. Although it has been shown that α-syn fibrillary aggregation can induce early synaptic and axonal impairment and cause nigrostriatal degeneration, we still ignore how and why α-syn fibrillation begins. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factors, key regulators of inflammation and apoptosis, are involved in the brain programming of systemic aging as well as in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. The NF-κB family of factors consists of five different subunits (c-Rel, p65/RelA, p50, RelB, and p52), which combine to form transcriptionally active dimers. Different findings point out a role of RelA in PD. Interestingly, the nuclear content of RelA is abnormally increased in nigral dopamine (DA) neurons and glial cells of PD patients. Inhibition of RelA exert neuroprotection against (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) MPTP and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) toxicity, suggesting that this factor decreases neuronal resilience. Conversely, the c-Rel subunit can exert neuroprotective actions. We recently described that mice deficient for c-Rel develop a PD-like motor and non-motor phenotype characterized by progressive brain α-syn accumulation and early synaptic changes preceding the frank loss of nigrostriatal neurons. This evidence supports that dysregulations in this transcription factors may be involved in the onset of PD. This review highlights observations supporting a possible interplay between NF-κB dysregulation and α-syn pathology in PD, with the aim to disclose novel potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder.},

Here, we show that a computational approach allows surprisingly accurate prediction of histone modifications solely from knowledge of transcription factor binding both at promoters and at potential distal regulatory elements. This accuracy significantly and substantially exceeds what could be achieved by using DNA sequence as an input feature. Remarkably, we show that transcription factor binding enables strikingly accurate predictions across different cell lines. Analysis of the relative importance of specific transcription factors as predictors of specific histone marks recapitulated known interactions between transcription factors and histone modifiers. Our results demonstrate that reported associations between histone marks and gene expression may be indirect effects caused by interactions between transcription factors and histone-modifying complexes.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary novelties have been important in the history of life, but their origins are usually difficult to examine in detail. We previously described the evolution of a novel trait, aerobic citrate utilization (Cit+), in an experimental population of Escherichia coli. Here we analyse genome sequences to investigate the history and genetic basis of this trait. At least three distinct clades coexisted for more than 10,000 generations before its emergence. The Cit+ trait originated in one clade by a tandem duplication that captured an aerobically expressed promoter for the expression of a previously silent citrate transporter. The clades varied in their propensity to evolve this novel trait, although genotypes able to do so existed in all three clades, implying that multiple potentiating mutations arose during the population’s history. Our findings illustrate the importance of promoter capture and altered gene regulation in mediating the exaptation events that often underlie evolutionary innovations.},

  abstract = {Taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene is the first dedicated intermediate in the metabolic pathway responsible for synthesizing the anticancer compound Taxol. In this study, the heterologous production of taxadiene was established in and analyzed between K- and B-derived Escherichia coli strains. First, recombinant parameters associated with precursor metabolism (the upstream methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway) and taxadiene biosynthesis (the downstream pathway) were varied to probe the effect different promoters and cellular backgrounds have on taxadiene production. Specifically, upstream MEP pathway genes responsible for the taxadiene precursors, dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate, were tested with an inducible T7 promoter system within K and B E. coli strains. Whereas, inducible T7, Trc, and T5 promoters were tested with the plasmid-borne geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase and taxadiene synthase genes responsible for the downstream pathway. The K-derivative produced taxadiene roughly 2.5-fold higher than the B-derivative. A transcriptomics study revealed significant differences in pyruvate metabolism between the K and B strains, providing insight into the differences observed in taxadiene biosynthesis and targets for future metabolic engineering efforts. Next, the effect of temperature on cell growth and taxadiene production was analyzed in these two strains, revealing similar phenotypes between the two with 22°C as the optimal production temperature. Lastly, the effect of indole on cell growth was investigated between the two strains, showing that the K-derivative demonstrated greater growth inhibition compared to the B-derivative.},

Lysosomes are dynamic organelles that degrade, in a controlled manner, cellular components delivered via the secretory, endocytic, autophagic and phagocytic membrane-trafficking pathways. Increasing amounts of evidence suggest a central role of lysosomal impairment in PD aetiology. This review provides an update on how genetic evidence support this connection and highlights how the neuropathologic and mechanistic evidence might relate to the disease process in sporadic forms of Parkinson’s disease. Finally, we discuss the influence of ageing on lysosomal impairment and PD aetiology and therapeutic strategies targeting lysosomal function.},

  abstract = {Building variant ribosomes offers opportunities to reveal fundamental principles underlying ribosome biogenesis and to make ribosomes with altered properties. However, cell viability limits mutations that can be made to the ribosome. To address this limitation, the in vitro integrated synthesis, assembly and translation (iSAT) method for ribosome construction from the bottom up was recently developed. Unfortunately, iSAT is complex, costly, and laborious to researchers, partially due to the high cost of reaction buffer containing over 20 components. In this study, we develop iSAT in Escherichia coli BL21Rosetta2 cell lysates, a commonly used bacterial strain, with a cost-effective poly sugar and nucleotide monophosphate-based metabolic scheme. We achieved a 10-fold increase in protein yield over our base case with an evolutionary design of experiments approach, screening 490 reaction conditions to optimize the reaction buffer. The computationally guided, cell-free, high-throughput technology presented here augments the way we approach multicomponent synthetic biology projects and efforts to repurpose ribosomes.},

  abstract = {Neurofibrillary degeneration has attracted the attention of neuroscientists as both a hallmark of the disease and a subject for experimentation for more than a century. Recent studies implicate phosphorylated tau (p-tau) directly in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis, although the human data continue to raise questions. P-tau accumulates with age in a roughly hierarchical manner, but avoids abundance in the neocortex unless co-occurring with amyloid-β. Neurodegenerative tauopathies tend to have p-tau morphologies that differ from aging and Alzheimer’s disease. Tau isoforms (3R vs. 4R) have a tendency to vary with tauopathy phenotype for unknown reasons. Selective vulnerability to p-tau and spatial-temporal disconnect from amyloid-β are evident in aging. P-tau assessment at autopsy involves tissue decomposition, which may skew microanatomical observations toward limited biological meaning. Two major consensus guidelines for interpreting p-tau at autopsy emphasize the challenges of clinicopathologic correlation, and reinforce the observation that regional neurodegeneration is a better correlate of clinical signs than is proteinopathy. Despite the proliferation of interesting and novel theories related to tau-mediated pathogenesis, the weight of the human observations suggests that neurofibrillary degeneration is an epiphenomenal hallmark of aging and disease rather than an epicenter of neurotoxicity. This is consistent with numerous tau-targeted therapeutic strategies that have been unsuccessful to date.},

The conventional research areas in which the droplets are studied include physical chemistry, fluid mechanics, chemical engineering, materials science, and micro- and nanotechnology. Typical studies include phenomena such as condensation and droplet formation, evaporation of droplets, or wetting of surfaces. The present article reviews the recent literature that employs droplets as animated soft matter. It is argued that droplets can be considered as liquid robots possessing some characteristics of living systems, and such properties can be applied to unconventional computing through maze solving or operation in logic gates. In particular, the lifelike properties and behavior of liquid robots, namely (i) movement, (ii) self-division, and (iii) group dynamics, will be discussed.},

In silico               methods reveal structural aspects of how it binds to its 11 natural cleavage sites, the design of novel peptide inhibitors, and insights into drug design.                        ,                             The main protease (M               pro               ) of SARS-CoV-2 is central to viral maturation and is a promising drug target, but little is known about structural aspects of how it binds to its 11 natural cleavage sites. We used biophysical and crystallographic data and an array of biomolecular simulation techniques, including automated docking, molecular dynamics (MD) and interactive MD in virtual reality, QM/MM, and linear-scaling DFT, to investigate the molecular features underlying recognition of the natural M               pro               substrates. We extensively analysed the subsite interactions of modelled 11-residue cleavage site peptides, crystallographic ligands, and docked COVID Moonshot-designed covalent inhibitors. Our modelling studies reveal remarkable consistency in the hydrogen bonding patterns of the natural M               pro               substrates, particularly on the N-terminal side of the scissile bond. They highlight the critical role of interactions beyond the immediate active site in recognition and catalysis, in particular plasticity at the S2 site. Building on our initial M               pro               -substrate models, we used predictive saturation variation scanning (PreSaVS) to design peptides with improved affinity. Non-denaturing mass spectrometry and other biophysical analyses confirm these new and effective ‘peptibitors’ inhibit M               pro               competitively. Our combined results provide new insights and highlight opportunities for the development of M               pro               inhibitors as anti-COVID-19 drugs.},

Enhancer-promoter interactions could be relatively stable as cells transition from progenitor to differentiated states; alternatively, chromatin looping could be as dynamic as the gene expression from their loci. The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly renewing mammalian tissue. Proliferative cells in crypts of Lieberkühn sustain a stream of differentiated cells~that are continually shed into the lumen. We apply chromosome conformation capture combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) and sequencing to measure enhancer-promoter interactions in progenitor and differentiated cells of the intestinal epithelium. Despite dynamic gene regulation across the differentiation axis, we find that enhancer-promoter interactions are relatively stable. Functionally, we find HNF4 transcription factors are required for chromatin looping at target genes. Depletion of HNF4 disrupts local chromatin looping, histone modifications, and target gene expression. This study provides insights into transcriptional regulatory mechanisms governing homeostasis in renewing tissues.},

  abstract = {Fibroblasts are found in abundance in the airway and distal lung. They orchestrate the continual production and turnover of the pulmonary extracellular matrix, the correct organization of which is vital for efficient gas exchange. The lung matrix also provides crucial structural support for various cells and exerts profound influences on their function. These interactions regulate normal airway and alveolar morphogenesis during fetal development, and regain prominence during repair responses following injury to these tissues. In addition to matrix formation, immune functions have also been ascribed to fibroblasts, including antigen presentation and the secretion of bioactive molecules. These roles highlight the versatility and indispensability of fibroblasts to the maintenance of normal lung physiology. Consequently, fibroblast dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disorders in which there is disproportionate extracellular matrix deposition (e.g., fibrotic lung diseases) or destruction (e.g., emphysematous and cystic lung disorders). In these settings, uncontrolled fibroblast activation and proliferation or, conversely, the loss of fibroblast number or function, contribute to the initiation and progression of abnormal lung repair. Substantial research efforts are being directed at identifying molecular targets and novel strategies to treat disorders characterized by pathological matrix remodeling.},

Starting from gene expression data, functions in this package identify sample-specific gene signatures and use them to build a graph of samples. In this graph samples are joined by edges if they have a similar expression profile, according to a pre-computed similarity matrix. The similarity between the expression profiles of two samples is computed using a method similar to GSEA. The graph of samples can then be used to perform community clustering or to perform supervised classification of samples in a testing set.},

  abstract = {Biosynthesis of the anticancer drug Taxol in Taxus (yew) species involves 19 steps from the universal diterpenoid progenitor geranylgeranyl diphosphate derived by the plastidial methyl erythritol phosphate pathway for isoprenoid precursor supply. Following the committed cyclization to the taxane skeleton, eight cytochrome P450-mediated oxygenations, three CoA-dependent acyl/aroyl transfers, an oxidation at C9, and oxetane (D-ring) formation yield the intermediate baccatin III, to which the functionally important C13-side chain is appended in five additional steps. To gain further insight about Taxol biosynthesis relevant to the improved production of this drug, and to draw inferences about the organization, regulation, and origins of this complex natural product pathway, Taxus suspension cells (induced for taxoid biosynthesis by methyl jasmonate) were used for feeding studies, as the foundation for cell-free enzymology and as the source of transcripts for cDNA library construction and a variety of cloning strategies. This approach has led to the elucidation of early and late pathway segments, the isolation and characterization of over half of the pathway enzymes and their corresponding genes, and the identification of candidate cDNAs for the remaining pathway steps, and it has provided many promising targets for genetically engineering more efficient biosynthetic production of Taxol and its precursors.},

  abstract = {THE presidential address delivered by Prof. Schäfer to the British Association in 1912, and the subsequent independent discussion at a joint sitting of two of the sections, served, as was pointed out by Prof. Armstrong in a paper in Science Progress in October last, “as a useful corrective to the wave of vitalism that has passed over society of late years owing to the pervasive eloquence of Bergson and other writers.” Probably the majority of those who have studied the phenomena of life from the chemical side will agree with Prof. Schäfer in his dictum that “at the best vitalism explains nothing,” and accept his opinion “that we may fairly conclude that all changes in living substance are brought about by ordinary chemical and physical forces.” The difficulty, however, lies in obtaining any satisfactory information as to what are the actual chemical or physical changes which occur in the real living cells or tissues. Since this discussion was held Prof. S. Leduc, of the School of Medicine at Nantes, has published a monograph 1 in which he approaches the problem from the novel point of view which now for several years past has guided his experiments and with which readers of his “Mechanism of Life” will be familiar.},

  abstract = {Cancer is a dynamic disease. During the course of disease, cancers generally become more heterogeneous. As a result of this heterogeneity, the bulk tumour might include a diverse collection of cells harbouring distinct molecular signatures with differential levels of sensitivity to treatment. This heterogeneity might result in a non-uniform distribution of genetically distinct tumour-cell subpopulations across and within disease sites (spatial heterogeneity) or temporal variations in the molecular makeup of cancer cells (temporal heterogeneity). Heterogeneity provides the fuel for resistance; therefore, an accurate assessment of tumour heterogeneity is essential for the development of effective therapies. Multiregion sequencing, single-cell sequencing, analysis of autopsy samples, and longitudinal analysis of liquid biopsy samples are all emerging technologies with considerable potential to dissect the complex clonal architecture of cancers. In this Review, we discuss the driving forces behind intratumoural heterogeneity and the current approaches used to combat this heterogeneity and its consequences. We also explore how clinical assessments of tumour heterogeneity might facilitate the development of more-effective personalized therapies.},

Cultivation-free community-wide approaches like bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing recently revolutionized the study of such human-associated microbial diversity, and the continuously decreasing cost/throughput ratio of current sequencing platforms is further enhancing the availability and effectiveness of microbiome research. The IonTorrent PGM platform is among the latest available commercial high-throughput sequencing tools, but it is just starting to be used for 16S rRNA surveys with only episodic assessments of its performance. We present here the first IonTorrent profiling of the human saliva microbiome collected from 12 healthy individuals. In this cohort, a subset of the volunteers was asked to assume a probiotic product, in order to investigate its impact on the composition and the structure of the saliva microbiome. Analysis of the generated dataset suggests the suitability of the IonTorrent platform for 16S rRNA surveys, even though some platform-specific choices are required to optimize the consistency of the obtained bacterial profiles. Interestingly, we found a marked and statistically significant increase of the overall bacterial diversity in the saliva of individuals who received the probiotic product compared to the control group, suggesting a short-term effect of probiotic product administration on oral microbiome composition.},

While most popular molecular dynamics packages inevitably provide PCA tools to analyze protein trajectories, researchers often make inferences of their results without having insight into how to make interpretations, and they are often unaware of limitations and generalizations of such analysis. Here we review best practices for applying standard PCA, describe useful variants, discuss why one may wish to make comparison studies, and describe a set of metrics that make comparisons possible. In practice, one will be forced to make inferences about the essential dynamics of a protein without having the desired amount of samples. Therefore, considerable time is spent on describing how to judge the significance of results, highlighting pitfalls. The topic of PCA is reviewed from the perspective of many practical considerations, and useful recipes are provided.},

Each outcome is assigned a “utility” value based on the preferences of the decision maker. An optimal decision, following the logic of the theory, is one that maximizes the expected utility.

  abstract = {Most cellular processes rely on large multiprotein complexes that must assemble into a well-defined quaternary structure in order to function. A number of prominent examples, including the 20S core particle of the proteasome and the AAA+ family of ATPases, contain ring-like structures. Developing an understanding of the complex assembly pathways employed by ring-like structures requires a characterization of the problems these pathways have had to overcome as they evolved. In this work, we use computational models to uncover one such problem: a deadlocked plateau in the assembly dynamics. When the molecular interactions between subunits are too strong, this plateau leads to significant delays in assembly and a reduction in steady-state yield. Conversely, if the interactions are too weak, assembly delays are caused by the instability of crucial intermediates. Intermediate affinities thus maximize the efficiency of assembly for homomeric ring-like structures. In the case of heteromeric rings, we find that rings including at least one weak interaction can assemble efficiently and robustly. Estimation of affinities from solved structures of ring-like complexes indicates that heteromeric rings tend to contain a weak interaction, confirming our prediction. In addition to providing an evolutionary rationale for structural features of rings, our work forms the basis for understanding the complex assembly pathways of stacked rings like the proteasome and suggests principles that would aid in the design of synthetic ring-like structures that self-assemble efficiently.},

  abstract = {Chemokines have several physio-pathological roles in the brain. Among them, the modulation of synaptic contacts and neurotransmission recently emerged as crucial activities during brain development, in adulthood, upon neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. CXCL16 is a chemokine normally expressed in the brain, where it exerts neuroprotective activity against glutamate-induced damages through cross communication with astrocytes and the involvement of the adenosine receptor type 3 (A3R) and the chemokine CCL2. Here we demonstrated for the first time that CXCL16 exerts a modulatory activity on inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission in CA1 area. We found that CXCL16 increases the frequency of the miniature inhibitory synaptic currents (mIPSCs) and the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs), suggesting a presynaptic modulation of the probability of GABA release. In addition, CXCL16 increases the frequency of the miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSCs) and reduces the PPR of evoked excitatory transmission, indicating that the chemokine also modulates and enhances the release of glutamate. These effects were not present in the A3RKO mice and in WT slices treated with minocycline, confirming the involvement of A3 receptors and introducing microglial cells as key mediators of the modulatory activity of CXCL16 on neurons.},

Over the last twenty years, increasing evidence prompted the development of new experimental techniques to study genome structure. In parallel with the complexity of the novel techniques, computational approaches have become an essential tool in any structural genomics laboratory to analyze and model the data. For biologists to be able to apply the most appropriate modeling approach, it is fundamental to understand the conceptual bases of distinct methods and the insights they can provide. Here, we will discuss recent advances that were possible thanks to 3D genome modeling, discuss their limitations and highlight future perspectives.},

The synergistic application of experimental approaches and computer simulations has helped to unveil how these organizational layers of the genome interplay in various organisms. However, such multidisciplinary approaches are still rarely explored in the plant kingdom. Here, we provide an overview of our current knowledge on plant 3D genome organization and review recent efforts to integrate cutting-edge experiments from microscopy and next-generation sequencing approaches with theoretical models.

However, the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms driving the crosstalk between nuclear architecture and (epi)genomic information is still lacking. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a powerful model organism to address these questions owing to its compact genome for which we have a rich collection of microscopy, chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and ChIP-seq experiments. Using polymer modelling, we investigate the roles of nucleolus formation and epigenomics-driven interactions in shaping the 3D genome of A. thaliana. By validation of several predictions with published data, we demonstrate that self-attracting nucleolar organizing regions and repulsive constitutive heterochromatin are major mechanisms to regulate the organization of chromosomes. Simulations also suggest that interphase chromosomes maintain a partial structural memory of the V-shapes, typical of (sub)metacentric chromosomes in anaphase. Additionally, self-attraction between facultative heterochromatin regions facilitates the formation of Polycomb bodies hosting H3K27me3-enriched gene-clusters. Since nucleolus and heterochromatin are highly-conserved in eukaryotic cells, our findings pave the way for a comprehensive characterization of the generic principles that are likely to shape and regulate the 3D genome in many species.},

We apply TADdyn on in situ Hi-C time-course experiments studying the reprogramming of murine B cells to pluripotent cells, and characterize the structural rearrangements that take place upon changes in the transcriptional state of 21 genomic loci of diverse expression dynamics. By measuring various structural and dynamical properties, we find that during gene activation, the transcription starting site contacts with open and active regions in 3D chromatin domains. We propose that these 3D hubs of open and active chromatin may constitute a general feature to trigger and maintain gene transcription.},

This in part could be due to issues such as the difficulty of achieving selectivity when targeting protease active sites.

  abstract = {Single cells displaying many characteristics in common with smooth muscle are now being identified in many organs. Although their origin remains elusive, they are nonetheless known to play a major role in fibroproliferative diseases and stromal reactions by virtue of their contractile properties. We have investigated the contractile properties and expression of smooth muscle-associated proteins in such a cell line derived from human foetal lung (IMR-90). For almost two decades, these cells have served as model fibroblasts in a wide variety of studies. And yet, IMR-90 cells manifest many features characteristic of differentiated smooth muscle cells: they exhibit the same elongated, slender form and the strikingly regular, longitudinal alignment of their actin-attachment sites, which are indispensable for coordinated contraction. Moreover, these adhaerens junctions also contain metavinculin, the smooth muscle analogue of vinculin, the stable expression of which has not previously been demonstrated in cultured cells. Since sm 22, as well as the smooth muscle-associated α-actin isoform and calponin are also expressed, IMR-90 cells must now be classified as myofibroblasts. When cultivated on a rubbery silicon surface, IMR-90 cells respond to stimulation with a rate of contraction which is considerably faster than that exhibited by fibroblasts derived from other established lines. Taken together, the regular longitudinal orientation of the adhaerens junctions, the stable expression of metavinculin, and the rapid speed of shortening in IMR-90 cells suggest, by implication, that the periodicity of actin attachment sites is a fundamental determinant of contractile efficiency in smooth muscle cells; this spacing may be mediated by metavinculin. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The main function identifies active      subnetworks in a protein-protein interaction network using a user-provided      list of genes and associated p values. It then performs enrichment analyses      on the identified subnetworks, identifying enriched terms (i.e. pathways or,      more broadly, gene sets) that possibly underlie the phenotype of interest.     pathfindR also offers functionalities to cluster the enriched terms and      identify representative terms in each cluster, to score the enriched terms      per sample and to visualize analysis results.

  abstract = {Taxol®, which is also known as paclitaxel, is a chemotherapeutic agent widely used to treat different cancers. Since the discovery of its antitumoral activity, Taxol® has been used to treat over one million patients, making it one of the most widely employed antitumoral drugs. Taxol® was the first microtubule targeting agent described in the literature, with its main mechanism of action consisting of the disruption of microtubule dynamics, thus inducing mitotic arrest and cell death. However, secondary mechanisms for achieving apoptosis have also been demonstrated. Despite its wide use, Taxol® has certain disadvantages. The main challenges facing Taxol® are the need to find an environmentally sustainable production method based on the use of microorganisms, increase its bioavailability without exerting adverse effects on the health of patients and minimize the resistance presented by a high percentage of cells treated with paclitaxel. This review details, in a succinct manner, the main aspects of this important drug, from its discovery to the present day. We highlight the main challenges that must be faced in the coming years, in order to increase the effectiveness of Taxol® as an anticancer agent.},

  abstract = {Background Genomic hybridization platforms, including BAC-CGH and genotyping arrays, have been used to estimate chromosome copy number (CN) in tumor samples by detecting the relative strength of genomic signal. The methods rely on the assumption that the predominant chromosomal background of the samples is diploid, an assumption that is frequently incorrect for tumor samples. In addition to generally greater resolution, an advantage of genotyping arrays over CGH arrays is the ability to detect signals from individual alleles, allowing estimation of loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) and allelic ratios to enhance the interpretation of copy number alterations. Copy number events associated with LOH potentially have the same genetic consequences as deletions. Results We have utilized allelic ratios to detect patterns that are indicative of higher ploidy levels. An integrated analysis using allelic ratios, total signal and LOH indicates that many or most of the chromosomes from 24 glioblastoma tumors are in fact aneuploid. Some putative whole-chromosome losses actually represent trisomy, and many apparent sub-chromosomal losses are in fact relative losses against a triploid or tetraploid background. Conclusion These results suggest a re-interpretation of previous findings based only on total signal ratios. One interesting observation is that many single or multiple-copy deletions occur at common putative tumor suppressor sites subsequent to chromosomal duplication; these losses do not necessarily result in LOH, but nonetheless occur in conspicuous patterns. The 500 K Mapping array was also capable of detecting many sub-mega base losses and gains that were overlooked by CGH-BAC arrays, and was superior to CGH-BAC arrays in resolving regions of complex CN variation.},

To explore TAD structure and function, we developed a polymer model that can extract the full repertoire of chromatin conformations within TADs from population-based 3C data. This model predicts actual physical distances and to what extent chromosomal contacts vary between cells. It also identifies interactions within single TADs that stabilize boundaries between TADs and allows us to identify and genetically validate key structural elements within TADs. Combining the model's predictions with high-resolution DNA FISH and quantitative RNA FISH for TADs within the X-inactivation center (Xic), we dissect the relationship between transcription and spatial proximity to cis-regulatory elements. We demonstrate that contacts between potential regulatory elements occur in the context of fluctuating structures rather than stable loops and propose that such fluctuations may contribute to asymmetric expression in the Xic during X inactivation.},

However, it is difficult to observe these dynamics directly over long periods and across entire genomes. Here we analyse the dynamics of molecular evolution in twelve experimental populations of Escherichia coli, using whole-genome metagenomic sequencing at five hundred-generation intervals through sixty thousand generations. Although the rate of fitness gain declines over time, molecular evolution is characterized by signatures of rapid adaptation throughout the duration of the experiment, with multiple beneficial variants simultaneously competing for dominance in each population. Interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes play an important role, as long-term quasi-stable coexistence arises spontaneously in most populations, and evolution continues within each clade. We also present evidence that the targets of natural selection change over time, as epistasis and historical contingency alter the strength of selection on different genes. Together, these results show that long-term adaptation to a constant environment can be a more complex and dynamic process than is often assumed.},

  abstract = {Introduction High prices for insulin pose a barrier to treatment for people living with diabetes, with an estimated 50\% of 100 million patients needing insulin lacking reliable access. As insulin analogues replace regular human insulin (RHI) globally, their relative prices will become increasingly important. Three originator companies control 96\% of the global insulin market, and few biosimilar insulins are available. We estimated the price reductions that could be achieved if numerous biosimilar manufacturers entered the insulin market. Methods Data on the price of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) exported from India were retrieved from an online customs database. Manufacturers of insulins were contacted for price quotes. Where market API prices could not be identified, prices were estimated based on comparison of similarity, in terms of manufacturing process, with APIs for which prices were available. Potential biosimilar prices were estimated by adding costs of excipients, formulation, transport, development and regulatory costs, and a profit margin. Results The manufacturing processes for RHI and insulin analogues are similar. API prices were US\$24 750/kg for RHI, US\$68 757/kg for insulin glargine and an estimated US\$100 000/kg for other analogues. Estimated biosimilar prices were US\$48–71 per patient per year for RHI, US\$49–72 for neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin and US\$78–133 for analogues (except detemir: US\$283–365). Conclusion Treatment with biosimilar RHI and insulin NPH could cost ≤US\$72 per year and with insulin analogues ≤US\$133 per year. Estimated biosimilar prices were markedly lower than the current prices for insulin analogues. Widespread availability at estimated prices may allow substantial savings globally.},

Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn the cis-regulatory grammars encoded in regulatory DNA sequences associated with transcription factor binding and chromatin accessibility. Several feature attribution methods have been developed for estimating the predictive importance of individual features (nucleotides or motifs) in any input DNA sequence to its associated output prediction from a DNN model. However, these methods do not reveal higher-order feature interactions encoded by the models.We present a new method called Deep Feature Interaction Maps (DFIM) to efficiently estimate interactions between all pairs of features in any input DNA sequence. DFIM accurately identifies ground truth motif interactions embedded in simulated regulatory DNA sequences. DFIM identifies synergistic interactions between GATA1 and TAL1 motifs from in~vivo TF binding models. DFIM reveals epistatic interactions involving nucleotides flanking the core motif of the Cbf1 TF in yeast from in~vitro TF binding models. We also apply DFIM to regulatory sequence models of in~vivo chromatin accessibility to reveal interactions between regulatory genetic variants and proximal motifs of target TFs as validated by TF binding quantitative trait loci. Our approach makes significant strides in improving the interpretability of deep learning models for genomics.Code is available at: https://github.com/kundajelab/dfim.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

It also provides guidance for analyzing some ‘enhanced’ sampling approaches. We do not discuss systematic errors arising, e.g., from inaccuracy in the chosen model or force field.},

Here, we systematically review and update the vast state-of-the-art literature of Aβ science with evidence from basic research studies to human genetic and multi-modal biomarker investigations, which supports a crucial role of Aβ pathway dyshomeostasis in AD pathophysiological dynamics. We discuss the evidence highlighting a differentiated interaction of distinct Aβ species with other AD-related biological mechanisms, such as tau-mediated, neuroimmune and inflammatory changes, as well as a neurochemical imbalance. Through the lens of the latest development of multimodal in vivo biomarkers of AD, this cross-disciplinary review examines the compelling hypothesis- and data-driven rationale for Aβ-targeting therapeutic strategies in development for the early treatment of AD.},

  abstract = {Nuclear compartments are prominent features of 3D chromatin organization, but sequencing depth limitations have impeded investigation at ultra fine-scale. CTCF loops are generally studied at a finer scale, but the impact of looping on proximal interactions remains enigmatic. Here, we critically examine nuclear compartments and CTCF loop-proximal interactions using a combination of in situ Hi-C at unparalleled depth, algorithm development, and biophysical modeling. Producing a large Hi-C map with 33 billion contacts in conjunction with an algorithm for performing principal component analysis on sparse, super massive matrices~(POSSUMM), we resolve compartments to 500\,bp. Our results demonstrate that essentially all active promoters and distal enhancers localize in the A compartment, even when flanking sequences do not. Furthermore, we find that the TSS and TTS of paused genes are often segregated into separate compartments. We then identify diffuse interactions that radiate from CTCF loop anchors, which correlate with strong enhancer-promoter interactions and proximal transcription. We also find that these diffuse interactions depend on CTCF’s RNA binding domains. In this work, we demonstrate features of fine-scale chromatin organization consistent with a revised model in which compartments are more precise than commonly thought while CTCF loops are more protracted.},

Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) has become a powerful, routinely applied tool to analyze the genome architecture specifically on the micro-scale. A plethora of well characterized FISH probes (e.g., DNA, PNA) are commercially available which are specific for gene targets, centromeres, telomeres, whole chromosome territories and sub-chromosomal domains. Together with standardized protocols these probes are delivered as ready-to-use kits for fluorescence microscopy of 3D conserved cell nuclei in biological research as well as for clinical diagnostics. In this article, some developments of FISH are reviewed and characteristic steps of the procedure are described. Examples are presented. With the development of super-resolution microscopy for nano-scale investigations, requirements for nano-FISH probes promoted the development of oligonucleotide based FISH techniques as for instance COMBinatorial Oligo FISH (COMBO-FISH). The development of COMBO-FISH is also reviewed especially with respect to low temperature approaches that allow the combination of COMBO-FISH with other epigenetic techniques like immunostaining with specific antibodies. Examples are presented for analyses by super-resolution single molecule localization microscopy.},

  abstract = {Regulation of biological processes typically incorporates mechanisms that initiate and terminate the process and, where understood, these mechanisms often involve feedback control. Regulation of transcription is a fundamental cellular process where the mechanisms involved in initiation have been studied extensively, but those involved in arresting the process are poorly understood. Modeling of the potential roles of RNA in transcriptional control suggested a non-equilibrium feedback control mechanism where low levels of RNA promote condensates formed by electrostatic interactions whereas relatively high levels promote dissolution of these condensates. Evidence from in~vitro and in~vivo experiments support a model where RNAs produced during early steps in transcription initiation stimulate condensate formation, whereas the burst of RNAs produced during elongation stimulate condensate dissolution. We propose that transcriptional regulation incorporates a feedback mechanism whereby transcribed RNAs initially stimulate but then ultimately arrest the process.},

As a result of these changes, the theoretical formal view of physics has gradually shifted, so as to focus on the pragmatic and useful. General but vague approaches are being superceded by specific results for definite models. During this evolving change of emphasis I learned, developed, and described my simulation skills at Michigan, at Duke, at Livermore, and in Nevada, while forming increasingly wide-ranging contacts around the world. Computation is now pervasive in all the scientific fields. My own focus has been on the physics of particle simulations, mainly away from equilibrium. I outline my particle work here.

  abstract = {It remains unclear why acute depletion of CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) and cohesin only marginally affects expression of most genes despite substantially perturbing three-dimensional (3D) genome folding at the level of domains and structural loops. To address this conundrum, we used high-resolution Micro-C and nascent transcript profiling in mouse embryonic stem cells. We find that enhancer–promoter (E–P) interactions are largely insensitive to acute (3-h) depletion of CTCF, cohesin or WAPL. YY1 has been proposed as a structural regulator of E–P loops, but acute YY1 depletion also had minimal effects on E–P loops, transcription and 3D genome folding. Strikingly, live-cell, single-molecule imaging revealed that cohesin depletion reduced transcription factor (TF) binding to chromatin. Thus, although CTCF, cohesin, WAPL or YY1 is not required for the short-term maintenance of most E–P interactions and gene expression, our results suggest that cohesin may facilitate TFs to search for and bind their targets more efficiently.},

  abstract = {Whereas folding of genomes at the large scale of epigenomic compartments and topologically associating domains is now relatively well understood, how chromatin is folded at finer scales remains largely unexplored in mammals. Here, we overcome some limitations of conventional 3C-based methods by using high-resolution Micro-C to probe links between 3D genome organization and transcriptional regulation in mouse stem cells. Combinatorial binding of transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin modifiers spatially segregates TAD regions into various finer-scale structures with distinct regulatory features including stripes, dots, and domains linking promoters-to-promoters (P-P) or enhancers-to-promoters (E-P), and bundle contacts between Polycomb regions. E-P stripes extending from the edge of domains predominantly link co-expressed loci, often in the absence of CTCF and cohesin occupancy. Acute inhibition of transcription disrupts these gene-related folding features without altering higher-order chromatin structures. Our study uncovers previously obscured finer-scale genome organization, establishing functional links between chromatin folding and gene regulation., Hsieh et al. describe chromatin folding at single-nucleosome resolution in mammalian cells using Micro-C, an enhanced chromosome conformation capture method. Micro-C uncovers genome-wide, fine-scale chromatin organizational features shaped by gene activity, transcriptional regulation, and gene silencing.,},

VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations," in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

  abstract = {The main proteases (Mpro), also termed 3-chymotrypsin-like proteases (3CLpro), are a class of highly conserved cysteine hydrolases in β-coronaviruses. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that 3CLpros play an indispensable role in viral replication and have been recognized as key targets for preventing and treating coronavirus-caused infectious diseases, including COVID-19. This review is focused on the structural features and biological function of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease Mpro (also known as 3CLpro), as well as recent advances in discovering and developing SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors. To better understand the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors, the inhibition activities, inhibitory mechanisms, and key structural features of various 3CLpro inhibitors (including marketed drugs, peptidomimetic, and non-peptidomimetic synthetic compounds, as well as natural compounds and their derivatives) are summarized comprehensively. Meanwhile, the challenges in this field are highlighted, while future directions for designing and developing efficacious 3CLpro inhibitors as novel anti-coronavirus therapies are also proposed. Collectively, all information and knowledge presented here are very helpful for understanding the structural features and inhibitory mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors, which offers new insights or inspiration to medicinal chemists for designing and developing more efficacious 3CLpro inhibitors as novel anti-coronavirus agents.},

  abstract = {Studies of the human microbiome have revealed that even healthy individuals differ remarkably in the microbes that occupy habitats such as the gut, skin and vagina. Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat’s signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81–99\% of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome.},

  abstract = {Developments in the genome organisation field has resulted in the recent methodology to infer spatial conformations of the genome directly from experimentally measured genome contacts (Hi-C data). This provides a detailed description of both intra- and inter-chromosomal arrangements. Chromosomal intermingling is an important driver for radiation-induced DNA mis-repair. Which is a key biological endpoint of relevance to the fields of cancer therapy (radiotherapy), public health (biodosimetry) and space travel. For the first time, we leverage these methods of inferring genome organisation and couple them to nano-dosimetric radiation track structure modelling to predict quantities and distribution of DNA damage within cell-type specific geometries. These nano-dosimetric simulations are highly dependent on geometry and are benefited from the inclusion of experimentally driven chromosome conformations. We show how the changes in Hi-C contract maps impact the inferred geometries resulting in significant differences in chromosomal intermingling. We demonstrate how these differences propagate through to significant changes in the distribution of DNA damage throughout the cell nucleus, suggesting implications for DNA repair fidelity and subsequent cell fate. We suggest that differences in the geometric clustering for the chromosomes between the cell-types are a plausible factor leading to changes in cellular radiosensitivity. Furthermore, we investigate changes in cell shape, such as flattening, and show that this greatly impacts the distribution of DNA damage. This should be considered when comparing in vitro results to in vivo systems. The effect may be especially important when attempting to translate radiosensitivity measurements at the experimental in vitro level to the patient or human level.},

  abstract = {Information theory provides a constructive criterion for setting up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge, and leads to a type of statistical inference which is called the maximum-entropy estimate. It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.},

A homology-based cloning strategy, employing an induced Taxus cell library, yielded a cDNA encoding taxadiene 5α-hydroxylase, which was functionally expressed in yeast and insect cells. The recombinant enzyme was characterized and shown to efficiently utilize both taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene and taxa-4(20),11(12)-diene (as an adventitious substrate) to synthesize taxa-4(20),11(12)-dien-5α-ol. This hydroxylase resembles, in sequence and properties, other cytochrome P450 oxygenases of taxol biosynthesis. The utilization of both taxadiene isomers in the formation of taxa-4(20),11(12)-dien-5α-ol is novel, suggesting a reaction mechanism involving promiscuous radical abstraction with selective oxygen insertion rather than epoxidation of the C4,C5-alkene of the natural substrate and allylic rearrangement of the resulting taxa-11(12)-en-4,5epoxide.},

Currently, there are no targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease, and effective treatment options remain very limited. Here we describe the results of a programme that aimed to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, by combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening. This programme focused on identifying drug leads that target main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2: Mpro is a key enzyme of coronaviruses and has a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for SARS-CoV-25,6. We identified a mechanism-based inhibitor (N3) by computer-aided drug design, and then determined the crystal structure of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with this compound. Through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed more than 10,000~compounds—including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials and other pharmacologically active compounds—as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these compounds inhibited Mpro, showing half-maximal inhibitory concentration values that ranged from 0.67 to 21.4~μM. One of these compounds (ebselen) also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases for which no specific drugs or vaccines are available.},

On standard 2D pathologic examination, fibroblast foci are considered small, distinct lesions, although they have been proposed to form a highly interconnected reticulum as the leading edge of a "wave" of fibrosis. Here, we characterized fibroblast focus morphology and interrelationships in 3D using an integrated micro-CT and histological methodology. In 3D, fibroblast foci were morphologically complex structures, with large variations in shape and volume (range, 1.3 × 104 to 9.9 × 107 μm3). Within each tissue sample numerous multiform foci were present, ranging from a minimum of 0.9 per mm3 of lung tissue to a maximum of 11.1 per mm3 of lung tissue. Each focus was an independent structure, and no interconnections were observed. Together, our data indicate that in 3D fibroblast foci form a constellation of heterogeneous structures with large variations in shape and volume, suggesting previously unrecognized plasticity. No evidence of interconnectivity was identified, consistent with the concept that foci represent discrete sites of lung injury and repair.},

Here, we demonstrate that the five genetic components essential for cardiac specification in Drosophila, including the effectors of Wg and Dpp signaling, act as a collective unit to cooperatively regulate heart~enhancer activity, both in~vivo and in~vitro. Their combinatorial binding does not require any specific motif orientation or spacing, suggesting an alternative mode of enhancer function whereby cooperative activity occurs with extensive motif flexibility. A~fraction of enhancers co-occupied by cardiogenic TFs had unexpected activity in the neighboring visceral mesoderm but could be rendered active in heart through single-site mutations. Given that cardiac and visceral cells are both derived from the dorsal mesoderm, this "dormant" TF binding signature may represent a molecular footprint of these cells' developmental lineage.},

A combination of classical biochemical and molecular methods, including cell-free enzyme studies and differential-display of mRNA-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) combined with a homology-based searching and random sequencing of a cDNA library from induced T. cuspidata cells, led to the discovery of six novel cytochrome P450 taxoid (taxane diterpenoid) hydroxylases. These genes show unusually high sequence similarity with each other ({$>$}70\%) but low similarity ({$<$}30\%) to, and significant evolutionary distance from, other plant P450s. Despite their high similarity, functional analysis of these hydroxylases demonstrated distinctive substrate specificities responsible for an early bifurcation in the biosynthetic pathway after the initial hydroxylation of the taxane core at C5, leading into a biosynthetic network of competing, but interconnected, branches. The use of surrogate substrates, in cases where the predicted taxoid precursors were not available, led to the discovery of two core oxygenases, the 2α- and the 7β-hydroxylase. This general approach could accelerate the functional analysis of candidate cDNAs from the extant family of P450 genes to identify the remaining oxygenation steps of this complex pathway.},

  abstract = {Adaptive evolution is, to a large extent, a complex combinatorial optimization process. Such processes can be characterized as "uphill walks on rugged fitness landscapes". Concrete examples of fitness landscapes include the distribution of any specific functional property such as the capacity to catalyze a specific reaction, or bind a specific ligand, in "protein space". In particular, the property might be the affinity of all possible antibody molecules for a specific antigenic determinant. That affinity landscape presumably plays a critical role in maturation of the immune response. In this process, hypermutation and clonal selection act to select antibody V region mutant variants with successively higher affinity for the immunizing antigen. The actual statistical structure of affinity landscapes, although knowable, is currently unknown. Here, we analyze a class of mathematical models we call NK models. We show that these models capture significant features of the maturation of the immune response, which is currently thought to share features with general protein evolution. The NK models have the important property that, as the parameter K increases, the "ruggedness" of the NK landscape varies from a single peaked "Fujiyama" landscape to a multi-peaked "badlands" landscape. Walks to local optima on such landscapes become shorter as K increases. This fact allows us to choose a value of K that corresponds to the experimentally observed number of mutational "steps", 6-8, taken as an antibody sequence matures. If the mature antibody is taken to correspond to a local optimum in the model, tuning the model requires that K be about 40, implying that the functional contribution of each amino acid in the V region is affected by about 40 others. Given this value of K, the model then predicts several features of "antibody space" that are in qualitative agreement with experiment: (1) The fraction of fitter variants of an initial "roughed in" germ line antibody amplified by clonal selection is about 1-2\%. (2) Mutations at some sites of the mature antibody hardly affect antibody function at all, but mutations at other sites dramatically decrease function. (3) The same "roughed in" antibody sequence can "walk" to many mature antibody sequences. (4) Many adaptive walks can end on the same local optimum. (5) Comparison of different mature sequences derived from the same initial V region shows evolutionary hot spots and parallel mutations. All these predictions are open to detailed testing by obtaining monoclonal antibodies early in the immune response and carrying out in vitro mutagenesis and adaptive hill climbing with respect to affinity for the immunizing antigen.},

In CUT\&Tag, a chromatin protein is bound in situ by a specific antibody, which then tethers a protein A-Tn5 transposase fusion protein. Activation of the transposase efficiently generates fragment libraries with high resolution and exceptionally low background. All steps from live cells to sequencing-ready libraries can be performed in a single tube on the benchtop or a microwell in a high-throughput pipeline, and the entire procedure can be performed in one day.

To fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. Using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. We compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. We also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.},

  abstract = {In biochemical networks, reactions often occur on disparate timescales and can be characterized as either fast or slow. The quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) utilizes timescale separation to project models of biochemical networks onto lower-dimensional slow manifolds. As a result, fast elementary reactions are not modeled explicitly, and their effect is~captured by nonelementary reaction-rate functions (e.g., Hill functions). The accuracy of the QSSA applied to deterministic systems depends on how well timescales are separated. Recently, it has been proposed to use the nonelementary rate functions obtained via the deterministic QSSA to define propensity functions in stochastic simulations of biochemical networks. In this approach, termed the stochastic QSSA, fast reactions that are part of nonelementary reactions are not simulated, greatly reducing computation time. However, it is unclear when the stochastic QSSA provides an accurate approximation of the original stochastic simulation. We show that, unlike the deterministic QSSA, the validity of the stochastic QSSA does not follow from timescale separation alone, but also depends on the sensitivity of the nonelementary reaction rate functions to changes in the slow species. The stochastic QSSA becomes more accurate when this sensitivity is small. Different types of QSSAs result in nonelementary functions with different sensitivities, and the total QSSA results in less sensitive functions than the standard or the prefactor QSSA. We prove that, as a result, the stochastic QSSA becomes more accurate when nonelementary reaction functions are obtained using the total QSSA. Our work provides an apparently novel condition for the validity of the QSSA in stochastic simulations of biochemical reaction networks with disparate timescales.},

A critical question in the field has been what the protonation states of the ionizable residues in the substrate-binding active-site cavity are; resolving this point would help understand the catalytic details of the enzyme and inform rational drug development against this pernicious virus. Here, we present the room-temperature neutron structure of 3CL Mpro, which allowed direct determination of hydrogen atom positions and, hence, protonation states in the protease. We observe that the catalytic site natively adopts a zwitterionic reactive form in which Cys145 is in the negatively charged thiolate state and His41 is doubly protonated and positively charged, instead of the neutral unreactive state usually envisaged. The neutron structure also identified the protonation states, and thus electrical charges, of all other amino acid residues and revealed intricate hydrogen-bonding networks in the active-site cavity and at the dimer interface. The fine atomic details present in this structure were made possible by the unique scattering properties of the neutron, which is an ideal probe for locating hydrogen positions and experimentally determining protonation states at near-physiological temperature. Our observations provide critical information for structure-assisted and computational drug design, allowing precise tailoring of inhibitors to the enzyme's electrostatic environment.},

Here we present an analysis tool, VarScan 2, for the detection of somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) in exome data from tumor-normal pairs. Unlike most current approaches, our algorithm reads data from both samples simultaneously; a heuristic and statistical algorithm detects sequence variants and classifies them by somatic status (germline, somatic, or LOH); while a comparison of normalized read depth delineates relative copy number changes. We apply these methods to the analysis of exome sequence data from 151 high-grade ovarian tumors characterized as part of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We validated some 7790 somatic coding mutations, achieving 93\% sensitivity and 85\% precision for single nucleotide variant (SNV) detection. Exome-based CNA analysis identified 29 large-scale alterations and 619 focal events per tumor on average. As in our previous analysis of these data, we observed frequent amplification of oncogenes (e.g., CCNE1, MYC) and deletion of tumor suppressors (NF1, PTEN, and CDKN2A). We searched for additional recurrent focal CNAs using the correlation matrix diagonal segmentation (CMDS) algorithm, which identified 424 significant events affecting 582 genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate the robust performance of VarScan 2 for somatic mutation and CNA detection and shed new light on the landscape of genetic alterations in ovarian cancer.},

  abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. While a number of non-motor manifestations arise, the typical clinical features involve a movement disorder consisting of bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity, with postural instability occurring at a later stage. The cause of PD is not known, but a number of genetic risk factors have now been characterized, as well as several genes which cause rare familial forms of PD. Environmental influences such as smoking, caffeine consumption, and pesticide exposure have been postulated to alter the risk of PD development, although the role of these remains unclear. The movement disorder arises due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, with the pathological hallmark being intracellular aggregates of α-synuclein, in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Several processes have been implicated in PD, including mitochondrial dysfunction, defective protein clearance mechanisms, and neuroinflammation, but the way in which these factors interact remains incompletely understood.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers integrate positional and temporal information to regulate the complex expression of developmentally controlled genes. Current models suggest that enhancers act as computational devices, receiving multiple inputs from activators and repressors and resolving them into a single positive or a negative signal that is transmitted to the basal transcriptional machinery. We show that a simple, compact enhancer is capable of representing both repressed and activated states at the same time and in the same nucleus. This finding suggests that closely apposed factor binding sites, situated within compact cis-elements, can be independently interpreted by the transcriptional machinery, possibly through successive enhancer-promoter interactions. These results provide clear evidence that the computational functions usually ascribed to the enhancer itself are actually shared with the basal machinery. In contrast to the autonomous computer model of enhancer function, an information-display or `billboard' model of enhancer activity may better describe many developmentally regulated transcriptional enhancers.},

We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease.

We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

Using genome-wide Chromatin Interaction Analysis with Paired-End-Tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), we mapped long-range chromatin interactions associated with RNA polymerase II in human cells and uncovered widespread promoter-centered intra-genic, extra-genic and inter-genic interactions. These interactions further aggregated into higher-order clusters, wherein proximal and distal genes were engaged through promoter-promoter interactions. Most genes with promoter-promoter interactions were active and transcribed cooperatively, and some interacting promoters could influence each other implying combinatorial complexity of transcriptional controls. Comparative analyses of different cell lines showed that cell-specific chromatin interactions could provide structural frameworks for cell-specific transcription, and suggested significant enrichment of enhancer-promoter interactions for cell-specific functions. Furthermore, genetically-identified disease-associated non-coding elements were found to be spatially engaged with corresponding genes through long-range interactions. Overall, our study provides insights into the transcription regulation by three-dimensional chromatin interactions for both housekeeping and cell-specific genes in human cells.},

The ETC is fundamental for mitochondrial energy production which is essential for neuronal health. In the past two decades, more than 20 PD-associated genes have been identified. Some are directly involved in mitochondrial functions, such as PRKN, PINK1, and DJ-1. While other PD-associate genes, such as LRRK2, SNCA, and GBA1, regulate lysosomal functions, lipid metabolism, or protein aggregation, some have been shown to indirectly affect the electron transport chain. The recent identification of CHCHD2 and UQCRC1 that are critical for functions of complex IV and complex III, respectively, provide direct evidence that PD is more than just a complex I disorder. Like UQCRC1 in preventing cytochrome c from release, functions of ETC proteins beyond oxidative phosphorylation might also contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.},

  abstract = {Regulation of gene expression requires both transcription factor (TFs) and epigenetic modifications, and interplays between the two types of factors have been discovered. However study of relationships between chromatin features and TF–TF co-occupancy remains limited. Here, we revealed the relationship by first illustrating distinct profile patterns of chromatin features related to different binding events, including single TF binding and TF–TF co-occupancy of 71 TFs from five human cell lines. We further implemented statistical analyses to demonstrate the relationship by accurately predicting co-occupancy genome-widely using chromatin features including DNase I hypersensitivity, 11 histone modifications (HMs) and GC content. Remarkably, our results showed that the combination of chromatin features enables accurate predictions across the five cells. For individual chromatin features, DNase I enables high and consistent predictions. H3K27ac, H3K4me 2, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac are more reliable predictors than other HMs. Although the combination of 11 HMs achieves accurate predictions, their predictive ability varies considerably when a model obtained from one cell is applied to others, indicating relationship between HMs and TF–TF co-occupancy is cell type dependent. GC content is not a reliable predictor, but the addition of GC content to any other features enhances their predictive ability. Together, our results elucidate a strong relationship between TF–TF co-occupancy and chromatin features.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Tumor purity (TP) is the proportion of cancer cells in a tumor sample. TP impacts on the accurate assessment of molecular and genomics features as assayed with NGS approaches. State-of-the-art tools mainly rely on somatic copy-number alterations (SCNA) to quantify TP and therefore fail when a tumor genome is nearly euploid, i.e. 'non-aberrant' in terms of identifiable SCNAs. RESULTS: We introduce a computational method, tumor purity estimation from single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), which derives TP from the allelic fraction distribution of SNVs. On more than 7800 whole-exome sequencing data of TCGA tumor samples, it showed high concordance with a range of TP tools (Spearman's correlation between 0.68 and 0.82; {$>$}9 SNVs) and rescued TP estimates of 1, 194 samples (15\%) pan-cancer. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: TPES is available as an R package on CRAN and at https://bitbucket.org/l0ka/tpes.git. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Identification of the bacterium responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management. However, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain. OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of DNA extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: In a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) O104:H4 in Germany. Samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (August-September 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (November 2012-February 2013). In phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. In phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. In phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak strain. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The recovery of genome sequence data for the purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other pathogens from fecal samples. RESULTS: During phase 1, a draft genome of the STEC outbreak strain was obtained. During phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. Sequences from the Shiga-toxin genes were detected in 27 of 40 STEC-positive samples (67\%). In phase 3, sequences from Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter concisus, and Salmonella enterica were recovered. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. Challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs.},

  abstract = {The assessment of microbial diversity and distribution is a major concern in environmental microbiology. There are two general approaches for measuring community diversity: quantitative measures, which use the abundance of each taxon, and qualitative measures, which use only the presence/absence of data. Quantitative measures are ideally suited to revealing community differences that are due to changes in relative taxon abundance (e.g., when a particular set of taxa flourish because a limiting nutrient source becomes abundant). Qualitative measures are most informative when communities differ primarily by what can live in them (e.g., at high temperatures), in part because abundance information can obscure significant patterns of variation in which taxa are present. We illustrate these principles using two 16S rRNA-based surveys of microbial populations and two phylogenetic measures of community beta diversity: unweighted UniFrac, a qualitative measure, and weighted UniFrac, a new quantitative measure, which we have added to the UniFrac website (http://bmf.colorado.edu/unifrac). These studies considered the relative influences of mineral chemistry, temperature, and geography on microbial community composition in acidic thermal springs in Yellowstone National Park and the influences of obesity and kinship on microbial community composition in the mouse gut. We show that applying qualitative and quantitative measures to the same data set can lead to dramatically different conclusions about the main factors that structure microbial diversity and can provide insight into the nature of community differences. We also demonstrate that both weighted and unweighted UniFrac measurements are robust to the methods used to build the underlying phylogeny.},

  abstract = {Coronaviruses infect a variety of hosts in the animal kingdom, and while each virus is taxonomically different, they all infect their host via the same mechanism. The coronavirus main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro), is an attractive target for drug development due to its essential role in mediating viral replication and transcription. An Mpro inhibitor, GC376, has been shown to treat feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal infection in cats caused by internal mutations in the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Recently, our lab demonstrated that the feline drug, GC373, and prodrug, GC376, are potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and solved the structures in complex with the drugs; however, no crystal structures of the FIP virus (FIPV) Mpro with the feline drugs have been published so far. Here, we present crystal structures of FIPV Mpro-GC373/GC376 complexes, revealing the inhibitors covalently bound to Cys144 in the active site, similar to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Additionally, GC376 has a higher affinity for FIPV Mpro with lower nanomolar Ki values compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We also show that improved derivatives of GC376 have higher potency for FIPV Mpro. Since GC373 and GC376 represent strong starting points for structure-guided drug design, determining the crystal structures of FIPV Mpro with these inhibitors are important steps in drug optimization and structure-based broad-spectrum antiviral drug discovery.},

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is called COVID-19, which is highly contagious and has an overall mortality rate of 6.35\% as of May 26, 2020. There is no vaccine or antiviral available for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report our discovery of inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, and XII were identified to have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay. The mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies, thermal shift binding assays, and native mass spectrometry. Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC50 values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37\,µM. Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known substrate-based peptidomimetic Mpro inhibitors. A complex crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with GC-376, determined at 2.15\,Å resolution with three protomers per asymmetric unit, revealed two unique binding configurations, shedding light on the molecular interactions and protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate and inhibitor binding by Mpro. Overall, the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.},

We analyzed bacteria from whole-population samples frozen every 500 generations through 20,000 generations for one well-studied population, called Ara-1. By tracking 42 known mutations in these samples, we reconstructed the history of this population's genotypic evolution over this period. The evolutionary dynamics of Ara-1 show strong evidence of selective sweeps as well as clonal interference between competing lineages bearing different beneficial mutations. In some cases, sets of several mutations approached fixation simultaneously, often conveying no information about their order of origination; we present several possible explanations for the existence of these mutational cohorts. Against a backdrop of rapid selective sweeps both earlier and later, two genetically diverged clades coexisted for {$>$}6000 generations before one went extinct. In that time, many additional mutations arose in the clade that eventually prevailed. We show that the clades evolved a frequency-dependent interaction, which prevented the immediate competitive exclusion of either clade, but which collapsed as beneficial mutations accumulated in the clade that prevailed. Clonal interference and frequency dependence can occur even in the simplest microbial populations. Furthermore, frequency dependence may generate dynamics that extend the period of coexistence that would otherwise be sustained by clonal interference alone.},

While the molecular mechanisms of rRNA transcription regulation have been elucidated in great detail, the functional organization of the multicopy rRNA gene clusters (rDNA) in the nucleolus is less well understood. Here we apply super-resolution 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to investigate the spatial organization of transcriptionally competent active rDNA chromatin at size scales well below the diffraction limit by optical microscopy. We identify active rDNA chromatin units exhibiting uniformly ring-shaped conformations with diameters of \textasciitilde 240\,nm in mouse and \textasciitilde 170\,nm in human fibroblasts, consistent with rDNA looping. The active rDNA chromatin units are clearly separated from each other and from the surrounding areas of rRNA processing. Simultaneous imaging of all active genes bound by Pol I and the architectural chromatin protein Upstream Binding Transcription Factor (UBF) reveals a random spatial orientation of regular repeats of rDNA coding sequences within the nucleoli. These observations imply rDNA looping and exclude potential formation of systematic spatial assemblies of the well-ordered repetitive arrays of transcription units. Collectively, this study uncovers key features of the 3D organization of active rDNA chromatin units and their nucleolar clusters providing a spatial framework of nucleolar chromatin organization at unprecedented detail.},

  abstract = {Genomic analyses in cancer have been enormously impactful, leading to the identification of driver mutations and development of targeted therapies. But the functions of the vast majority of somatic mutations and copy number variants in tumours remain unknown, and the causes of resistance to targeted therapies and methods to overcome them are poorly defined. Recent improvements in mass spectrometry-based proteomics now enable direct examination of the consequences of genomic aberrations, providing deep and quantitative characterization of tumour tissues. Integration of proteins and their post-translational modifications with genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic data constitutes the new field of proteogenomics, and is already leading to new biological and diagnostic knowledge with the potential to improve our understanding of malignant transformation and therapeutic outcomes. In this Review we describe recent developments in proteogenomics and key findings from the proteogenomic analysis of a wide range of cancers. Considerations relevant to the selection and use of samples for proteogenomics and the current technologies used to generate, analyse and integrate proteomic with genomic data are described. Applications of proteogenomics in translational studies and immuno-oncology are rapidly emerging, and the prospect for their full integration into therapeutic trials and clinical care seems bright.},

It is assumed that future states depend only on the current state, not on the events that occurred before it (that is, it assumes the Markov property). Generally, this assumption enables reasoning and computation with the model that would otherwise be intractable. For this reason, in the fields of predictive modelling and probabilistic forecasting, it is desirable for a given model to exhibit the Markov property.},

Although essential for embryogenesis, bivalency is functionally not well understood. Here, we show that MLL2 plays a central role in ESC genome organization. We generate a catalog of bona fide bivalent genes in ESCs and demonstrate that loss of MLL2 leads to increased Polycomb occupancy. Consequently, promoters lose accessibility, long-range interactions are redistributed, and ESCs fail to differentiate. We pose that bivalency balances accessibility and long-range connectivity of promoters, allowing developmental gene expression to be properly modulated.},

Up to very recently amyloid formation was considered a very slow process of deposition of an abnormal protein due to genetic abnormalities or post-translational modification of the deposited protein. Recent data suggest that the process of amyloidogenesis may be much more rapid in many cases and due to multiple mechanisms., We have found a mouse model of progressive neurodegeneration that resemble motor, behavioral and pathological hallmarks of parkinsonism and tauopathies, but surprisingly, also present amyloid deposits in brain and peripheral organs. Here we review some of these recent works which may provide new insight into the process of formation of amyloid and, perhaps, new ideas for its treatment.},

  abstract = {Genetic studies promise to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes (T2D). Variants associated with T2D are often located in tissue-specific enhancer clusters or super-enhancers. So far, such domains have been defined through clustering of enhancers in linear genome maps rather than in three-dimensional (3D) space. Furthermore, their target genes are often unknown. We have created promoter capture Hi-C maps in human pancreatic islets. This linked diabetes-associated enhancers to their target genes, often located hundreds of kilobases away. It also revealed {$>$}1,300 groups of islet enhancers, super-enhancers and active promoters that form 3D hubs, some of which show coordinated glucose-dependent activity. We demonstrate that genetic variation in hubs impacts insulin secretion heritability, and show that hub annotations can be used for polygenic scores that predict T2D risk driven by islet regulatory variants. Human islet 3D chromatin architecture, therefore, provides a framework for interpretation of T2D genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals.},

  abstract = {We present a simple method for utilizing experimental data to improve the efficiency of numerical calculations of free energy profiles from molecular dynamics simulations. The method involves umbrella sampling simulations with restraining potentials based on a known approximate estimate of the free energy profile derived solely from experimental data. The use of the experimental data results in optimal restraining potentials, guides the simulation along relevant pathways, and decreases overall computational time. In demonstration of the method, two systems are showcased. First, guided, unguided (regular) umbrella sampling simulations and exhaustive sampling simulations are compared to each other in the calculation of the free energy profile for the distance between the ends of a pentapeptide. The guided simulation use restraints based on a simulated “experimental” potential of mean force of the end-to-end distance that would be measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (obtained from exhaustive sampling). Statistical analysis shows a dramatic improvement in efficiency for a 5 window guided umbrella sampling over 5 and 17 window unguided umbrella sampling simulations. Moreover, the form of the potential of mean force for the guided simulations evolves, as one approaches convergence, along the same milestones as the extensive simulations, but exponentially faster. Second, the method is further validated by replicating the forced unfolding pathway of the titin I27 domain using guiding umbrella sampling potentials determined from actual single molecule pulling data. Comparison with unguided umbrella sampling reveals that the use of guided sampling encourages unfolding simulations to converge faster to a forced unfolding pathway that agrees with previous results and produces a more accurate potential of mean force.},

  abstract = {Cytochrome P450b is an integral membrane protein of the rat hepatocyte endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which is cotranslationally inserted into the membrane but remains largely exposed on its cytoplasmic surface. The extreme hydrophobicity of the amino-terminal portion of P450b suggests that it not only serves to initiate the cotranslational insertion of the nascent polypeptide but that it also halts translocation of downstream portions into the lumen of the ER and anchors the mature protein in the membrane. In an in vitro system, we studied the cotranslational insertion into ER membranes of the normal P450b polypeptide and of various deletion variants and chimeric proteins that contain portion of P450b linked to segments of pregrowth hormone or bovine opsin. The results directly established that the amino-terminal 20 residues of P450b function as a combined insertion-halt-transfer signal. Evidence was also obtained that suggests that during the early stages of insertion, this signal enters the membrane in a loop configuration since, when the amino-terminal hydrophobic segment was placed immediately before a signal peptide cleavage site, cleavage by the luminally located signal peptidase took place. After entering the membrane, the P450b signal, however, appeared to be capable of reorienting within the membrane since a bovine opsin peptide segment linked to the amino terminus of the signal became translocated into the microsomal lumen. It was also found that, in addition to the amino-terminal combined insertion-halt-transfer signal, only one other segment within the P450b polypeptide, located between residues 167 and 185, could serve as a halt-transfer signal and membrane-anchoring domain. This segment was shown to prevent translocation of downstream sequences when the amino-terminal combined signal was replaced by the conventional cleavable insertion signal of a secretory protein.},

In contrast, in higher organisms that have larger genomes, TFs recognize sequences that are too short to define unique genomic positions. In addition, development of multicellular organisms requires molecular systems that are capable of executing combinatorial logical operations. Co-operative recognition of DNA by multiple TFs allows both definition of unique genomic positions in large genomes, and complex information processing at the level of individual regulatory elements. The TFs can co-operate in multiple different ways, and the precise mechanism used for co-operation determines important features of the regulatory interactions. Here, we present an overview of the structural basis of the different mechanisms by which TFs can cooperate, focusing on insight from recent functional studies and structural analyses of specific TF-TF-DNA complexes.},

  abstract = {Chromatin consists of a complex of DNA and histone proteins as its core components and plays an important role in both packaging DNA and regulating DNA metabolic pathways such as DNA replication, transcription, recombination, and chromosome segregation. Proper functioning of chromatin further involves a network of interactions among molecular complexes that modify chromatin structure and organization to affect the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors leading to the activation or repression of the transcription of target DNA loci. Based on its structure and compaction state, chromatin is categorized into euchromatin, heterochromatin, and centromeric chromatin. In this review, we discuss distinct chromatin factors and molecular complexes that constitute euchromatin—open chromatin structure associated with active transcription; heterochromatin—less accessible chromatin associated with silencing; centromeric chromatin—the site of spindle binding in chromosome segregation.},

  abstract = {Synthetic genetic programs promise to enable novel applications in industrial processes. For such applications, the genetic circuits that compose programs will require fidelity in varying and complex environments. In this work, we report the performance of two synthetic circuits in Escherichia coli under industrially relevant conditions, including the selection of media, strain, and growth rate. We test and compare two transcriptional circuits: an AND and a NOR gate. In E. coli DH10B, the AND gate is inactive in minimal media; activity can be rescued by supplementing the media and transferring the gate into the industrial strain E. coli DS68637 where normal function is observed in minimal media. In contrast, the NOR gate is robust to media composition and functions similarly in both strains. The AND gate is evaluated at three stages of early scale-up: 100 mL shake flask experiments, a 1 mL MTP microreactor, and a 10 L bioreactor. A reference plasmid that constitutively produces a GFP reporter is used to make comparisons of circuit performance across conditions. The AND gate function is quantitatively different at each scale. The output deteriorates late in fermentation after the shift from exponential to constant feed rates, which induces rapid resource depletion and changes in growth rate. In addition, one of the output states of the AND gate failed in the bioreactor, effectively making it only responsive to a single input. Finally, cells carrying the AND gate show considerably less accumulation of biomass. Overall, these results highlight challenges and suggest modified strategies for developing and characterizing genetic circuits that function reliably during fermentation.},

  abstract = {The cytochromes P450 (P450s or CYPs) constitute a large heme enzyme superfamily, members of which catalyze the oxidative transformation of a wide range of organic substrates, and whose functions are crucial to xenobiotic metabolism and steroid transformation in humans and other organisms. The P450 peroxygenases are a subgroup of the P450s that have evolved in microbes to catalyze the oxidative metabolism of fatty acids, using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant rather than NAD(P)H-driven redox partner systems typical of the vast majority of other characterized P450 enzymes. Early members of the peroxygenase (CYP152) family were shown to catalyze hydroxylation at the α and β carbons of medium-to-long-chain fatty acids. However, more recent studies on other CYP152 family P450s revealed the ability to oxidatively decarboxylate fatty acids, generating terminal alkenes with potential applications as drop-in biofuels. Other research has revealed their capacity to decarboxylate and to desaturate hydroxylated fatty acids to form novel products. Structural data have revealed a common active site motif for the binding of the substrate carboxylate group in the peroxygenases, and mechanistic and transient kinetic analyses have demonstrated the formation of reactive iron-oxo species (compounds I and II) that are ultimately responsible for hydroxylation and decarboxylation of fatty acids, respectively. This short review will focus on the biochemical properties of the P450 peroxygenases and on their biotechnological applications with respect to production of volatile alkenes as biofuels, as well as other fine chemicals.},

A multidisciplinary approach, involving mathematical and computational modeling in parallel with experimentation, is often crucial for gaining such insights and improving the efficiency of artificial gene network design. Here we used such an approach and developed a combinatorial promoter design strategy to characterize how the position and multiplicity of tetO2 operator sites within the GAL1 promoter affect gene expression levels and gene expression noise in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We observed stronger transcriptional repression and higher gene expression noise as a single operator site was moved closer to the TATA box, whereas for multiple operator-containing promoters, we found that the position and number of operator sites together determined the dose–response curve and gene expression noise. We developed a generic computational model that captured the experimentally observed differences for each of the promoters, and more detailed models to successively predict the behavior of multiple operator-containing promoters from single operator-containing promoters. Our results suggest that the independent binding of single repressors is not sufficient to explain the more complex behavior of the multiple operator-containing promoters. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of joint experimental–computational efforts and some of the challenges of using a bottom-up approach based on well characterized, isolated biomolecular components for predicting the behavior of complex, synthetic gene networks, e.g., the whole can be different from the sum of its parts.},

  abstract = {Human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes play an important role in the metabolism of drugs, steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Microsomal CYPs are anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by an N-terminal transmembrane (TM) helix that is connected to the globular catalytic domain by a flexible linker sequence. However, the structural and functional importance of the TM-helix is unclear because it has been shown that CYPs can still associate with the membrane and have enzymatic activity in reconstituted systems after truncation or modification of the N-terminal sequence. Here, we investigated the effect of mutations in the N-terminal TM-helix residues of two human steroidogenic enzymes, CYP 17A1 and CYP 19A1, that are major drug targets for cancer therapy. These mutations were originally introduced to increase the expression of the proteins in Escherichia coli. To investigate the effect of the mutations on protein-membrane interactions and function, we carried out coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the CYPs in a phospholipid bilayer. We confirmed the orientations of the globular domain in the membrane observed in the simulations by linear dichroism measurements in a Nanodisc. Whereas the behavior of CYP 19A1 was rather insensitive to truncation of the TM-helix, mutations in the TM-helix of CYP 17A1, especially W2A and E3L, led to a gradual drifting of the TM-helix out of the hydrophobic core of the membrane. This instability of the TM-helix could affect interactions with the allosteric redox partner, cytochrome b5, required for CYP 17A1's lyase activity. Furthermore, the simulations showed that the mutant TM-helix influenced the membrane interactions of the CYP 17A1 globular domain. In some simulations, the mutated TM-helix obstructed the substrate access tunnel from the membrane to the CYP active site, indicating a possible effect on enzyme function.},

Rates of MProWT and MProM catalyzed hydrolyses display substrate saturation kinetics and second-order dependency on the protein concentration. The addition of the prodrug GC376, an inhibitor of MProWT, to MProM leads to an increase in the dimer population and catalytic activity with increasing inhibitor concentration. The activity reaches a maximum corresponding to a dimer population in which one active site is occupied by the inhibitor and the other is available for catalytic activity. This phase is followed by a decrease in catalytic activity due to the inhibitor competing with the substrate. Detailed kinetics and equilibrium analyses are presented and a modified Michaelis-Menten equation accounts for the results. These observations provide conclusive evidence that dimer formation is coupled to catalytic activity represented by two equivalent active sites.},

Protein microarray is based on the specific antigen‑antibody reaction, such as any enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay, the specific reaction occurring on a miniaturized support (chip or slide), thus having the advantage of simultaneous evaluation of tens to thousands of molecules in small samples with a highly specific recognition for the detection system. In this review, we highlight the history of protein microarray technologies development and discuss this technology is stepping into the future. We present personalized medicine goals and discuss how protein microarray can aid in these goals, with an emphasis on several oncological diseases.

  abstract = {, The binding between two biomolecules is one of the most critical factors controlling many bioprocesses. Therefore, it is of great interest to derive a reliable method to calculate the free binding energy between two biomolecules. In this work, we have demonstrated that the binding affinity of ligands to proteins can be determined through biased sampling simulations. The umbrella sampling (US) method was applied on 20 protein–ligand complexes, including the cathepsin K (CTSK), type II dehydroquinase (DHQase), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), and factor Xa (FXa) systems. The ligand-binding affinity was evaluated as the difference between the largest and smallest values of the free-energy curve, which was obtained via a potential of mean force analysis. The calculated affinities differ sizably from the previously reported experimental values, with an average difference of ∼3.14 kcal/mol. However, the calculated results are in good correlation with the experimental data, with correlation coefficients of 0.76, 0.87, 0.96, and 0.97 for CTSK, DHQase, HSP90, and FXa, respectively. Thus, the binding free energy of a new ligand can be reliably estimated using our US approach. Furthermore, the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of binding affinity of these systems are 1.13, 0.90, 0.37, and 0.25 kcal/mol, for CTSK, DHQase, HSP90, and FXa, respectively. The small RMSE values indicate the good precision of the biased sampling method that can distinguish the ligands exhibiting similar binding affinities.},

Focusing on chromosomal regions that contribute to compartments, we discover distinct structures that, in spite of considerable variability, can predict whether such regions correspond to active (A-type) or inactive (B-type) compartments. Imaging through the depths of entire nuclei, we capture pairs of homologous regions in diploid cells, obtaining evidence that maternal and paternal homologous regions can be differentially organized.

Advances in high-throughput genotyping technology have markedly improved our understanding of global patterns of human genetic variation and suggest the potential to use large samples to uncover variation among closely spaced populations–. Here we characterize genetic variation in a sample of 3,000 European individuals genotyped at over half a million variable DNA sites in the human genome. Despite low average levels of genetic differentiation among Europeans, we find a close correspondence between genetic and geographic distances; indeed, a geographical map of Europe arises naturally as an efficient two-dimensional summary of genetic variation in Europeans. The results emphasize that when mapping the genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations can arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In addition, the results are relevant to the prospects of genetic ancestry testing; an individual’s DNA can be used to infer their geographic origin with surprising accuracy—often to within a few hundred kilometres.},

  abstract = {Objectives To identify the sociodemographic factors associated with variation in area-based breastfeeding in England; to calculate the predicted breastfeeding rates adjusted for sociodemographic variations. Design Ecological analysis of routine data using random effects logistic regression. Setting All 151 primary care trusts (PCTs) in England 2010–2011. Outcome measures PCT level data on breastfeeding: initiation, any and exclusive breastfeeding at 6–8 weeks. Results There was considerable variation in breastfeeding across PCTs (breastfeeding initiation mean 72\%, range 39–93\%; any breastfeeding at 6–8 weeks mean 45\%, range 19–83\%; exclusive breastfeeding at 6–8 weeks mean 32\%, range 14–58\%), with London PCTs reporting markedly higher rates. Maternal age was strongly associated with area-based breastfeeding, with a 4–6\% increase in odds of breastfeeding associated with a unit increase in the percentage of older mothers. Outside London, the proportion of the local population from a Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) background, compared with those from a White British background, was associated with higher breastfeeding (1–3\% increase in odds per unit increase in the proportion from a BME background). Area-based deprivation was associated with reduced odds of breastfeeding (21–32\% reduced odds comparing most deprived quintile to least deprived quintile). Weaker associations were observed between sociodemographic factors and breastfeeding in London PCTs. Very few PCTs reported breastfeeding figures substantially above or below the national average, having adjusted for variations in sociodemographic factors. Conclusions Our results show striking associations between sociodemographic factors and breastfeeding at the area level, with much of the variation in breastfeeding rates explained by the sociodemographic profile. The sociodemographic context of breastfeeding is clearly important at the area level as well as the individual level. Our findings can be used to inform decision-making relating to local priorities and service provision.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) orchestrate the gene expression programs that define each cell’s identity. The canonical TF accomplishes this with two domains, one that binds specific DNA sequences and the other that binds protein coactivators or corepressors. We find that at least half of TFs also bind RNA, doing so through a previously unrecognized domain with sequence and functional features analogous to the arginine-rich motif of the HIV transcriptional activator Tat. RNA binding contributes to TF function by promoting the dynamic association between DNA, RNA, and TF on chromatin. TF-RNA interactions are a conserved feature important for vertebrate development and disrupted in disease. We propose that the ability to bind DNA, RNA, and protein is a general property of many TFs and is fundamental to their gene regulatory function.},

The complex~interrelationships between pluripotency and chromatin factors are illustrated by X chromosome inactivation, regulatory control by noncoding RNAs, and environmental influences on cell states.

We leveraged 9,428 metagenomes to reconstruct 154,723 microbial genomes (45\% of high quality) spanning body sites, ages, countries, and lifestyles. We recapitulated 4,930 species-level genome bins (SGBs), 77\% without genomes in public repositories (unknown SGBs [uSGBs]). uSGBs are prevalent (in 93\% of well-assembled samples), expand underrepresented phyla, and are enriched in non-Westernized populations (40\% of the total SGBs). We annotated 2.85~M genes in SGBs, many associated with conditions including infant development (94,000) or Westernization (106,000). SGBs and uSGBs permit deeper microbiome analyses and increase the average mappability of metagenomic reads from 67.76\% to 87.51\% in the gut (median 94.26\%) and 65.14\% to 82.34\% in the mouth. We thus identify thousands of microbial genomes from yet-to-be-named species, expand the pangenomes of human-associated microbes, and allow better exploitation of metagenomic technologies.},

  abstract = {Pathological aggregation of tau and neuroinflammatory changes mark the clinical course of Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies. To understand the correlation between these pathological hallmarks and functional deficits, we assessed behavioral and physiological deficits in the PS19 mouse model, a broadly utilized model of tauopathy. At 9 months, PS19 mice have characteristic hyperactive behavior, a decline in motor strength, and deterioration in physiological conditions marked by lower body temperature, reduced body weight, and an increase in measures of frailty. Correlation of these deficits with different pathological hallmarks revealed that pathological tau species, characterized by soluble p-tau species, and tau seeding bioactivity correlated with impairment in grip strength and thermal regulation. On the other hand, astrocyte reactivity showed a positive correlation with the hyperactive behavior of the PS19 mice. These results suggest that a diverse spectrum of soluble pathological tau species could be responsible for different symptoms and that neuroinflammation could contribute to functional deficits independently from tau pathology. These observations enhance the necessity of a multi-targeted approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative tauopathies.},

Recently, many high-resolution apo and inhibitor-bound structures of M               pro               , a cysteine protease, have been determined, facilitating structure-based drug design. M               pro               plays a central role in the viral life cycle by catalyzing the cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins. In addition to the catalytic dyad His41–Cys145, M               pro               contains multiple histidines including His163, His164, and His172. The protonation states of these histidines and the catalytic nucleophile Cys145 have been debated in previous studies of SARS-CoV M               pro               , but have yet to be investigated for SARS-CoV-2. In this work we have used molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 M               pro               as a function of the protonation assignments for these residues. We simulated both the apo and inhibitor-bound enzyme and found that the conformational stability of the binding site, bound inhibitors, and the hydrogen bond networks of M               pro               are highly sensitive to these assignments. Additionally, the two inhibitors studied, the peptidomimetic N3 and an α-ketoamide, display distinct His41/His164 protonation-state-dependent stabilities. While the apo and the N3-bound systems favored N                                δ                              (HD) and N                                ϵ                              (HE) protonation of His41 and His164, respectively, the α-ketoamide was not stably bound in this state. Our results illustrate the importance of using appropriate histidine protonation states to accurately model the structure and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 M               pro               in both the apo and inhibitor-bound states, a necessary prerequisite for drug-design efforts.},

They can be used to search sequence data bases, evaluate similarity scores, and identify periodic structures based on local sequence similarity. The FASTA program is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP program, which can be used to search protein or DNA sequence data bases and can compare a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base by translating the DNA data base as it is searched. FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.},

An effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is still unavailable. Therefore, in this study, we have tried to predict a list of potential inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) using a combination of molecular docking and fast pulling of ligand (FPL) simulations. The approaches were initially validated over a set of eleven available inhibitors. Both Autodock Vina and FPL calculations produced consistent results with the experiments with correlation coefficients of               R               Dock               = 0.72 ± 0.14 and               R               W               = −0.76 ± 0.10, respectively. The combined approaches were then utilized to predict possible inhibitors that were selected from a ZINC15 sub-database for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Twenty compounds were suggested to be able to bind well to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Among them, five top-leads are               periandrin V               ,               penimocycline               ,               cis-p-Coumaroylcorosolic acid               ,               glycyrrhizin               , and               uralsaponin B               . The obtained results could probably lead to enhance the COVID-19 therapy.},

  abstract = {This unit describes a quantitative technique for measuring the lengths of telomere repeat sequences in individual chromosomes from single metaphase cells. The technique is based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) adapted for use with peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes. PNA is an example of novel synthetic oligonucleotide "mimetic" which has a higher affinity than regular oligonucleotide (RNA or DNA) probes for complementary single-strand (ss) DNA sequences. PNA oligonucleotides have excellent penetration properties due to their small size (typically 15 to 18-mers) and can be directly labeled with fluorochromes. These properties have been exploited to develop quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) onto denatured single-stranded chromosomal DNA target sequences. The latter can be present in preparations of fixed metaphase cells on slides (Q-FISH) or in heat-treated (interphase) cells in suspension (flow-FISH).},

Q-FISH is most commonly used to study telomere length, which in vertebrates are repetitive hexameric sequences (TTAGGG) located at the distal end of chromosomes.

  abstract = {Evolutionary innovations that enable organisms to colonize new ecological niches are rare compared to gradual evolutionary changes in existing traits. We discovered that key mutations in the gltA gene, which encodes citrate synthase (CS), occurred both before and after Escherichia coli gained the ability to grow aerobically on citrate (Cit+ phenotype) during the Lenski long-term evolution experiment. The first gltA mutation, which increases CS activity by disrupting NADH-inhibition of this enzyme, is beneficial for growth on the acetate and contributed to preserving the rudimentary Cit+ trait from extinction when it first evolved. However, after Cit+ was refined by further mutations, this potentiating gltA mutation became deleterious to fitness. A second wave of beneficial gltA mutations then evolved that reduced CS activity to below the ancestral level. Thus, dynamic reorganization of central metabolism made colonizing this new nutrient niche contingent on both co-opting and overcoming a history of prior adaptation.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

  abstract = {During embryogenesis, precise gene transcription in space and time requires that distal enhancers and promoters communicate by physical proximity within gene regulatory landscapes. To achieve this, regulatory landscapes fold in nuclear space, creating complex 3D structures that influence enhancer-promoter communication and gene expression and that, when disrupted, can cause disease. Here, we provide an overview of how enhancers and promoters construct regulatory landscapes and how multiple scales of 3D chromatin structure sculpt their communication. We focus on emerging views of what enhancer-promoter contacts and chromatin domains physically represent and how two antagonistic fundamental forces—loop extrusion and homotypic attraction—likely form them. We also examine how these same forces spatially separate regulatory landscapes by functional state, thereby creating higher-order compartments that reconfigure during development to enable proper enhancer-promoter communication.},

  abstract = {Taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene is the first committed precursor of functionalized taxanes such as paclitaxel, a successful anticancer drug. Biosynthesis of taxanes in yew involves several oxidations, a number of which have been shown to be catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 oxygenases. Hydroxylation of the C-5alpha of taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene is believed to be the first of these oxidations, and a gene encoding a taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene 5alpha-hydroxylase (CYP725A4) was recently described (Jennewein, S., Long, R. M., Williams, R. M., and Croteau, R. (2004) Chem. Biol. 11, 379-387). In an attempt to produce the early components of the paclitaxel pathway by a metabolic engineering approach, cDNAs encoding taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene synthase and CYP725A4 were introduced in Nicotiana sylvestris for specific expression in trichome cells. Their co-expression did not lead to the production of the expected 5alpha-hydroxytaxa-4(20),11(12)-diene. Instead, taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene was quantitatively converted to a novel taxane that was purified and characterized. Its structure was determined by NMR analysis and found to be that of 5(12)-oxa-3(11)-cyclotaxane (OCT) in which the eight-carbon B-ring from taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene is divided into two fused five-carbon rings. In addition, OCT contains an ether bridge linking C-5 and C-12 from opposite sides of the molecule. OCT was also the sole major product obtained after incubation of taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene with NADPH and microsomes prepared from recombinant yeast expressing CYP725A4. The rearrangement of the taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene ring system is thus mediated by CYP725A4 only and does not rely on additional enzymes or factors present in the plant. The complex structure of OCT led us to propose a reaction mechanism involving a sequence of events so far unknown in P-450 catalysis.},

Artemisinin, isolated from the herb Artemisia annua (sweet wormwood), is one drug that shows a high efficacy in killing multi-resistant strains of the parasite. The drug is extremely expensive, and high demand has led to a shortage of artemisinin, available only by extraction from the plant source. Ro et al. now report the development of a yeast strain engineered to carry a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from A. annua that can produce the drug precursor, artemisinic acid. Artemisinin can be synthesized from this precursor. If the efficiency of this process can be improved, this engineered yeast strain has the potential to alleviate the drug shortage.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and chromosome conformation capture (3C) are two powerful techniques for investigating the three-dimensional organization of the genome in interphase nuclei. The use of these techniques provides complementary information on average spatial distances (FISH) and contact probabilities (3C) for specific genomic sites. To infer the structure of the chromatin fiber or to distinguish functional interactions from random colocalization, it is useful to compare experimental data to predictions from statistical fiber models. The current estimates of the fiber stiffness derived from FISH and 3C differ by a factor of 5. They are based on the wormlike chain model and a heuristic modification of the Shimada-Yamakawa theory of looping for unkinkable, unconstrained, zero-diameter filaments. Here, we provide an extended theoretical and computational framework to explain the currently available experimental data for various species on the basis of a unique, minimal model of decondensing chromosomes: a kinkable, topologically constraint, semiflexible polymer with the (FISH) Kuhn length of lK = 300 nm, 10 kinks per Mbp, and a contact distance of 45 nm. In particular: 1), we reconsider looping of finite-diameter filaments on the basis of an analytical approximation (novel, to our knowledge) of the wormlike chain radial density and show that unphysically large contact radii would be required to explain the 3C data based on the FISH estimate of the fiber stiffness; 2),~we demonstrate that the observed interaction frequencies at short genomic lengths can be explained by the presence of a low concentration of curvature defects (kinks); and 3), we show that the most recent experimental 3C data for human chromosomes are in quantitative agreement with interaction frequencies extracted from our simulations of topologically confined model chromosomes.},

We use computer simulations to show that the existence and stability of territories is a kinetic effect that can be explained without invoking an underlying nuclear scaffold or protein-mediated interactions between DNA sequences. In particular, we show that the experimentally observed territory shapes and spatial distances between marked chromosome sites for human, Drosophila, and budding yeast chromosomes can be reproduced by a parameter-free minimal model of decondensing chromosomes. Our results suggest that the observed interphase structure and dynamics are due to generic polymer effects: confined Brownian motion conserving the local topological state of long chain molecules and segregation of mutually unentangled chains due to topological constraints.},

  abstract = {Background Charge states of ionizable residues in proteins determine their pH-dependent properties through their pKa values. Thus, various theoretical methods to determine ionization constants of residues in biological systems have been developed. One of the more widely used approaches for predicting pKa values in proteins is the PROPKA program, which provides convenient structural rationalization of the predicted pKa values without any additional calculations. Results The PROPKA Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a new tool for studying the pH-dependent properties of proteins such as charge and stabilization energy. It facilitates a quantitative analysis of pKa values of ionizable residues together with their structural determinants by providing a direct link between the pKa data, predicted by the PROPKA calculations, and the structure via the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) program. The GUI also calculates contributions to the pH-dependent unfolding free energy at a given pH for each ionizable group in the protein. Moreover, the PROPKA-computed pKa values or energy contributions of the ionizable residues in question can be displayed interactively. The PROPKA GUI can also be used for comparing pH-dependent properties of more than one structure at the same time. Conclusions The GUI considerably extends the analysis and validation possibilities of the PROPKA approach. The PROPKA GUI can conveniently be used to investigate ionizable groups, and their interactions, of residues with significantly perturbed pKa values or residues that contribute to the stabilization energy the most. Charge-dependent properties can be studied either for a single protein or simultaneously with other homologous structures, which makes it a helpful tool, for instance, in protein design studies or structure-based function predictions. The GUI is implemented as a Tcl/Tk plug-in for VMD, and can be obtained online at http://propka.ki.ku.dk/\textasciitilde luca/wiki/index.php/GUI\_Web.},

Here we demonstrate that the SE-enriched transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 form nuclear puncta at SEs that exhibit properties of liquid-like condensates and are disrupted by chemicals that perturb condensates. The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase-separated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts. These results support the idea that coactivators form phase-separated condensates at SEs that compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus, suggest a role for coactivator IDRs in this process, and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell-identity genes.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) has revealed the organization of chromatin~into topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops, which are thought to help regulate genome functions. TADs and loops are understood as the result of DNA extrusion mediated by the cohesin complex. However, despite recent efforts, direct visualization and quantification of this process in single cells remains an open challenge. Here, we use polymer simulations and dedicated analysis methods to explore if, and under which conditions, DNA loop extrusion can be detected and quantitatively characterized by imaging pairs of fluorescently labeled loci located near loop or TAD anchors in fixed or living cells. We find that under realistic conditions, extrusion can be detected and the frequency of loop formation can be quantified from fixed cell images alone, while the lifetime of loops and the speed of extrusion can be estimated from dynamic live-cell data. Our delineation of appropriate imaging conditions and the proposed analytical methods lay the groundwork for a systematic quantitative characterization of loop extrusion in fixed or living cells.},

As such, R loops seem to be a cause of tumorigenesis.Cells have two ways to limit the number of R loops in the genome: mechanisms that remove R loops, such as ribonucleases and RNA–DNA helicases; and mechanisms that prevent R-loop accumulation, such as RNA-processing factors or topoisomerase 1.R loops may play a part in transcription activation by directly affecting the chromatin structure of promoters and the recruitment of transcription or chromatin-remodelling factors. Such R loops may be formed by antisense non-coding RNAs.R loops trigger chromatin condensation and heterochromatin formation, which may explain their ability to repress or silence gene expression and to stall replication-fork progression, putatively leading to replication-fork breakage as the main source of R-loop-mediated genome instability.BRCA1 and BRCA2 have functions in double-strand break repair and/or replication-fork protection that may contribute to resolving intermediate structures such as stalled or broken replication forks that are generated as a consequence of R loops — thus these proteins facilitate the removal of R loops.},

This article summarizes the fundamentals of ANOVA for an intended benefit of the clinician reader of scientific literature who does not possess expertise in statistics. The emphasis is on conceptually-based perspectives regarding the use and interpretation of ANOVA, with minimal coverage of the mathematical foundations. Computational examples are provided. Assumptions underlying ANOVA include parametric data measures, normally distributed data, similar group variances, and independence of subjects. However, normality and variance assumptions can often be violated with impunity if sample sizes are sufficiently large and there are equal numbers of subjects in each group. A statistically significant ANOVA is typically followed up with a multiple comparison procedure to identify which group means differ from each other. The article concludes with a discussion of effect size and the important distinction between statistical significance and clinical significance.},

We investigated over a dozen modifications to the methods used in PSI-BLAST, with the goal of improving accuracy in finding true positive matches. To evaluate performance we used a set of 103 queries for which the true positives in yeast had been annotated by human experts, and a popular measure of retrieval accuracy (ROC) that can be normalized to take on values between 0 (worst) and 1 (best). The modifications we consider novel improve the ROC score from 0.758 ± 0.005 to 0.895 ± 0.003. This does not include the benefits from four modifications we included in the ‘baseline’ version, even though they were not implemented in PSI-BLAST version 2.0. The improvement in accuracy was confirmed on a small second test set. This test involved analyzing three protein families with curated lists of true positives from the non-redundant protein database. The modification that accounts for the majority of the improvement is the use, for each database sequence, of a positionspecific scoring system tuned to that sequence’s amino acid composition. The use of compositionbased statistics is particularly beneficial for largescale automated applications of PSI-BLAST.},

  abstract = {Plant systems utilize a diverse array of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) in their biosynthetic and detoxicative pathways. Those P450s in biosynthetic pathways play critical roles in the synthesis of lignins, UV protectants, pigments, defense compounds, fatty acids, hormones, and signaling molecules. Those in catabolic pathways participate in the breakdown of endogenous compounds and toxic compounds encountered in the environment. Because of their roles in this wide diversity of metabolic processes, plant P450 proteins and transcripts can serve as downstream reporters for many different biochemical pathways responding to chemical, developmental, and environmental cues. This review focuses initially on defining P450 biochemistries, nomenclature systems, and the relationships between genes in the extended P450 superfamily that exists in all plant species. Subsequently, it focuses on outlining the many approaches being used to assign function to individual P450 proteins and gene loci. The examples of assigned P450 activities that are spread throughout this review highlight the importance of understanding and utilizing P450 sequences as markers for linking biochemical pathway responses to physiological processes.}

Here we present evidence that REL-GATA synergy plays a pervasive role in the immune response. SELEX assays identified consensus binding sites that permitted the characterization of several immunity regulatory DNAs. The distribution of REL and GATA sites within these DNAs suggests that most or all fat-specific immunity genes contain a common organization of regulatory elements: closely linked REL and GATA binding sites positioned in the same orientation and located near the transcription start site. Aspects of this "regulatory code" are essential for the immune response. These results suggest that immunity regulatory DNAs contain constrained organizational features, which may be a general property of eukaryotic enhancers.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation methods produce trajectories of atomic positions (and optionally velocities and energies) as a function of time and provide a representation of the sampling of a given molecule's energetically accessible conformational ensemble. As simulations on the 10−100 ns time scale become routine, with sampled configurations stored on the picosecond time scale, such trajectories contain large amounts of data. Data-mining techniques, like clustering, provide one means to group and make sense of the information in the trajectory. In this work, several clustering algorithms were implemented, compared, and utilized to understand MD trajectory data. The development of the algorithms into a freely available C code library, and their application to a simple test example of random (or systematically placed) points in a 2D plane (where the pairwise metric is the distance between points) provide a means to understand the relative performance. Eleven different clustering algorithms were developed, ranging from top-down splitting (hierarchical) and bottom-up aggregating (including single-linkage edge joining, centroid-linkage, average-linkage, complete-linkage, centripetal, and centripetal-complete) to various refinement (means, Bayesian, and self-organizing maps) and tree (COBWEB) algorithms. Systematic testing in the context of MD simulation of various DNA systems (including DNA single strands and the interaction of a minor groove binding drug DB226 with a DNA hairpin) allows a more direct assessment of the relative merits of the distinct clustering algorithms. Additionally, means to assess the relative performance and differences between the algorithms, to dynamically select the initial cluster count, and to achieve faster data mining by “sieved clustering” were evaluated. Overall, it was found that there is no one perfect “one size fits all” algorithm for clustering MD trajectories and that the results strongly depend on the choice of atoms for the pairwise comparison. Some algorithms tend to produce homogeneously sized clusters, whereas others have a tendency to produce singleton clusters. Issues related to the choice of a pairwise metric, clustering metrics, which atom selection is used for the comparison, and about the relative performance are discussed. Overall, the best performance was observed with the average-linkage, means, and SOM algorithms. If the cluster count is not known in advance, the hierarchical or average-linkage clustering algorithms are recommended. Although these algorithms perform well, it is important to be aware of the limitations or weaknesses of each algorithm, specifically the high sensitivity to outliers with hierarchical, the tendency to generate homogenously sized clusters with means, and the tendency to produce small or singleton clusters with average-linkage.},

  abstract = {We have developed a partially recombinant, cell-free, protein-synthesis system reconstituted solely from those essential elements of the Escherichia coli translation system, termed protein synthesis using recombinant elements (PURE). It provides higher reaction controllability in comparison to crude cell-free protein-synthesis systems for translation studies and biotechnology applications. The PURE system stands out among translation methods in that it provides not only a simple and unique “reverse” purification method of separating the synthesized protein from reaction mixture, but also that the system can be tailor-made according to individual protein requirements. In this paper, two new approaches to obtaining active proteins are described: the use of molecular chaperones, and modification of the reaction conditions. Several possible applications of the PURE system are also discussed.},

  abstract = {alpha-Tocopherol (vitamin E) is a lipid-soluble antioxidant synthesized only by photosynthetic organisms. alpha-Tocopherol is an essential component of mammalian diets, and intakes in excess of the U.S. recommended daily allowance are correlated with decreased incidence of a number of degenerative human diseases. Plant oils, the main dietary source of tocopherols, typically contain alpha-tocopherol as a minor component and high levels of its biosynthetic precursor, gamma-tocopherol. A genomics-based approach was used to clone the final enzyme in alpha-tocopherol synthesis, gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase. Overexpression of gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase in Arabidopsis seeds shifted oil compositions in favor of alpha-tocopherol. Similar increases in agricultural oil crops would increase vitamin E levels in the average U.S. diet.},

  abstract = {Normalization means to adjust microarray data for effects which arise from variation in the technology rather than from biological differences between the RNA samples or between the printed probes. This paper describes normalization methods based on the fact that dye balance typically varies with spot intensity and with spatial position on the array. Print-tip loess normalization provides a well-tested general purpose normalization method which has given good results on a wide range of arrays. The method may be refined by using quality weights for individual spots. The method is best combined with diagnostic plots of the data which display the spatial and intensity trends. When diagnostic plots show that biases still remain in the data after normalization, further normalization steps such as plate-order normalization or scale-normalization between the arrays may be undertaken. Composite normalization may be used when control spots are available which are known to be not differentially expressed. Variations on loess normalization include global loess normalization and two-dimensional normalization. Detailed commands are given to implement the normalization techniques using freely available software.},

Recent investigations have documented the prion-like features of tau protein and the involvement of microglial changes with tau pathology. While it is still unclear what sequence of events is causal, it is likely that tau seeding potential and microglial contribution to tau propagation act together, and are essential for the development and progression of degenerative changes. Based on available evidence, targeting tau seeds and controlling some signaling pathways in a complex inflammation process could represent a possible new therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Recent findings propose novel diagnostic assays and markers that may be used together with standard methods to complete and improve the diagnosis and classification of these diseases. In conclusion, a novel perspective on microglia-tau relations reveals new issues to investigate and imposes different approaches for developing therapeutic strategies for AD.},

To learn whether human AD microglia (HAM) display a similar profile, we develop a method for purifying cell types from frozen cerebrocortical tissues for RNA-seq analysis, allowing better transcriptome coverage than typical single-nucleus RNA-seq approaches. The HAM profile we observe bears little resemblance to the DAM profile. Instead, HAM display an enhanced human aging profile, in addition to other disease-related changes such as APOE upregulation. Analyses of whole-tissue RNA-seq and single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq datasets corroborate our findings and suggest that the lack of DAM response in human microglia occurs specifically in AD tissues, not other neurodegenerative settings. These results, which can be browsed at http://research-pub.gene.com/BrainMyeloidLandscape, provide a genome-wide picture of microglial activation in human AD and highlight considerable differences between mouse models and human disease.},

  abstract = {The Drosophila genome activator Vielfaltig (Vfl), also known as Zelda (Zld), is thought to prime enhancers for activation by patterning transcription factors (TFs). Such priming is accompanied by increased chromatin accessibility, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we analyze the effect of Zld on genome-wide nucleosome occupancy and binding of the patterning TF Dorsal (Dl). Our results show that early enhancers are characterized by an intrinsically high nucleosome barrier. Zld tackles this nucleosome barrier through local depletion of nucleosomes with the effect being dependent on the number and position of Zld motifs. Without Zld, Dl binding decreases at enhancers and redistributes to open regions devoid of enhancer activity. We propose that Zld primes enhancers by lowering the high nucleosome barrier just enough to assist TFs in accessing their binding motifs and promoting spatially controlled enhancer activation if the right patterning TFs are present. We envision that genome activators in general will utilize this mechanism to activate the zygotic genome in a robust and precise manner.},

  abstract = {A key consideration in metabolic engineering is the determination of fluxes of the metabolites within the cell. This determination provides an unambiguous description of metabolism before and/or after engineering interventions. Here, we present a computational framework that combines a constraint-based modeling framework with isotopic label tracing on a large scale. When cells are fed a growth substrate with certain carbon positions labeled with 13C, the distribution of this label in the intracellular metabolites can be calculated based on the known biochemistry of the participating pathways. Most labeling studies focus on skeletal representations of central metabolism and ignore many flux routes that could contribute to the observed isotopic labeling patterns. In contrast, our approach investigates the importance of carrying out isotopic labeling studies using a more comprehensive reaction network consisting of 350 fluxes and 184 metabolites in Escherichia coli including global metabolite balances on cofactors such as ATP, NADH, and NADPH. The proposed procedure is demonstrated on an E. coli strain engineered to produce amorphadiene, a precursor to the antimalarial drug artemisinin. The cells were grown in continuous culture on glucose containing 20\% [U-13C]glucose; the measurements are made using GC–MS performed on 13 amino acids extracted from the cells. We identify flux distributions for which the calculated labeling patterns agree well with the measurements alluding to the accuracy of the network reconstruction. Furthermore, we explore the robustness of the flux calculations to variability in the experimental MS measurements, as well as highlight the key experimental measurements necessary for flux determination. Finally, we discuss the effect of reducing the model, as well as shed light onto the customization of the developed computational framework to other systems.},

Release 4.6 of GROMACS uses SIMD acceleration on a wide range of architectures, GPU offloading acceleration, and both OpenMP and MPI parallelism within and between nodes, respectively. The recent work on acceleration made it necessary to revisit the fundamental algorithms of molecular simulation, including the concept of neighborsearching, and we discuss the present and future challenges we see for exascale simulation - in particular a very fine-grained task parallelism. We also discuss the software management, code peer review and continuous integration testing required for a project of this complexity.},

There is still no effective treatment for the virus, resulting in the death of more than one million patients. Inhibiting the activity of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), 3C-like protease (3CLP), is able to block the viral replication and proliferation. In this context, our study has revealed that               in silico               screening for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro can be reliably done using the monomeric structure of the Mpro instead of the dimeric one.

The obtained results were also confirmed               via               binding pose and noncovalent contact analyses.

In detail, the correlation coefficient between US and experiments does not differ from FPL and is slightly smaller than LIE. The root mean square error of US simulations is smaller than that of LIE. Moreover, US is better than FPL and poorer than LIE in classifying SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors owing to the reciever operating characteristic–area under the curve analysis. Furthermore, the US simulations also provide detailed insights on unbinding pathways of ligands from the binding cleft of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

Several viral proteins domain swap to increase their structural complexity or functional avidity. The main protease (Mpro) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus proteolyzes viral polyproteins and has been a target for anti-SARS drug design. Domain swapping in the α-helical C-terminal domain of Mpro (MproC) locks Mpro into a hyperactive octameric form that is hypothesized to promote the early stages of viral replication. However, in the absence of a complete molecular understanding of the mechanism of domain swapping, investigations into the biological relevance of this octameric Mpro have stalled. Isolated MproC can exist as a monomer or a domain-swapped dimer. Here, we investigate the mechanism of domain swapping of MproC using coarse-grained structure-based models and molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations recapitulate several experimental features of MproC folding. Further, we find that a contact between a tryptophan in the MproC domain-swapping hinge and an arginine elsewhere forms early during folding, modulates the folding route, and promotes domain swapping to the native structure. An examination of the sequence and the structure of the tryptophan containing hinge loop shows that it has a propensity to form multiple secondary structures and contacts, indicating that it could be stabilized into either the monomer- or dimer-promoting conformations by mutations or ligand binding. Finally, because all residues in the tryptophan loop are identical in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, mutations that modulate domain swapping may provide insights into the role of octameric Mpro in the early-stage viral replication of both viruses.},

In a cross-continent meta-analysis exploiting {$>$}6,500 metagenomes, we obtained {$>$}1,000 genomes and explored the genetic and population structure of P.~copri. P.~copri encompasses four distinct clades ({$>$}10\% inter-clade genetic divergence) that we propose constitute the~P.~copri complex, and all clades were confirmed by isolate sequencing. These clades are nearly ubiquitous and co-present in non-Westernized populations. Genomic analysis showed substantial functional diversity in the complex with notable differences in carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that multi-generational dietary modifications may be driving reduced prevalence in Westernized populations. Analysis of ancient metagenomes highlighted patterns of P.~copri presence consistent with modern non-Westernized populations and a clade delineation time pre-dating human migratory waves out of Africa. These findings reveal that P.~copri exhibits a high diversity that is underrepresented in Western-lifestyle populations.},

  abstract = {Cis-Regulatory elements (cis-REs) include promoters, enhancers, and insulators that regulate gene expression programs via binding of transcription factors. ATAC-seq technology effectively identifies active cis-REs in a given cell type (including from single cells) by mapping accessible chromatin at base-pair resolution. However, these maps are not immediately useful for inferring specific functions of cis-REs. For this purpose, we developed a deep learning framework (CoRE-ATAC) with novel data encoders that integrate DNA sequence (reference or personal genotypes) with ATAC-seq cut sites and read pileups. CoRE-ATAC was trained on 4 cell types (n = 6 samples/replicates) and accurately predicted known cis-RE functions from 7 cell types (n = 40 samples) that were not used in model training (mean average precision = 0.80, mean F1 score = 0.70). CoRE-ATAC enhancer predictions from 19 human islet samples coincided with genetically modulated gain/loss of enhancer activity, which was confirmed by massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). Finally, CoRE-ATAC effectively inferred cis-RE function from aggregate single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC) data from human blood-derived immune cells that overlapped with known functional annotations in sorted immune cells, which established the efficacy of these models to study cis-RE functions of rare cells without the need for cell sorting. ATAC-seq maps from primary human cells reveal individual- and cell-specific variation in cis-RE activity. CoRE-ATAC increases the functional resolution of these maps, a critical step for studying regulatory disruptions behind diseases.},

However, studies regarding specific immune cell classification in the peripheral blood in PD remain lacking. Therefore, we aimed to explore the different immune status in patients with PD at different ages of onset. We included 22 patients; among them were 10 who had early-onset PD (EOPD) and 12 had late-onset PD (LOPD) and 10 young healthy controls (YHCs) and 8 elder HCs (EHCs). Mass cytometry staining technology was used to perform accurate immunotyping of cell populations in the peripheral blood. Motor symptoms and cognitive function were assessed using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III score and Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) score, respectively. T test and ANOVA statistical analysis were performed on the frequency of annotated cell population. Linear regression model was used to analyze the correlation between clusters and clinical symptoms. We characterized 60 cell clusters and discovered that the immune signature of PD consists of cluster changes, including decreased effector CD8+ T cells, lower cytotoxicity natural killer (NK) cells and increased activated monocytes in PD patients. In summary, we found that CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and monocytes were associated with PD. Furthermore, there may be some differences in the immune status of patients with EOPD and LOPD, suggesting differences in the pathogenesis between these groups.},

We here present PyInteraph, a tool for the analysis of structural ensembles inspired by graph theory. PyInteraph is a software suite designed to analyze MD and structural ensembles with attention to binary interactions between residues, such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions. PyInteraph also allows the different classes of intra- and intermolecular interactions to be represented, combined or alone, in the form of interaction graphs, along with performing network analysis on the resulting interaction graphs. The program also integrates the network description with a knowledge-based force field to estimate the interaction energies between side chains in the protein. It can be used alone or together with the recently developed xPyder PyMOL plugin through an xPyder-compatible format. The software capabilities and associated protocols are here illustrated by biologically relevant cases of study.

We previously developed a reconstruction method to resolve the 3D architecture of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes using 3C-based data. These models were congruent with fluorescent imaging validation. However, the limits of such methods have not systematically been assessed. Here we propose the first evaluation of a mean-field restraint-based reconstruction of genomes by considering diverse chromosome architectures and different levels of data noise and structural variability. The results show that: first, current scoring functions for 3D reconstruction correlate with the accuracy of the models; second, reconstructed models are robust to noise but sensitive to structural variability; third, the local structure organization of genomes, such as Topologically Associating Domains, results in more accurate models; fourth, to a certain extent, the models capture the intrinsic structural variability in the input matrices and fifth, the accuracy of the models can be a priori predicted by analyzing the properties of the interaction matrices. In summary, our work provides a systematic analysis of the limitations of a mean-field restrain-based method, which could be taken into consideration in further development of methods as well as their applications.},

The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool~that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},

The three subsets retained differences in cell size for up to 15 days of primary culture. Flow cytometric (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) measurements of forward-angle light scatter agreed well with fibroblast volume measured by image analysis and confirmed the utility of forward-angle light scatter for discriminating size subpopulations. Group II fibroblasts accumulated most rapidly by 8 days of culture and also contained the greatest proportion of S and G2/M phase cells as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Fibroblasts that were immunoreactive with antibodies to α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were found only in group III. In situ end labeling of fragmented DNA detected apoptotic cells in bothgroups II andIII, but double labeling for in situ end labeling and α-SMA revealed apoptotic cells in both the α-SMA-positive and -negative populations. These results demonstrate that primary human lung fibroblasts behave as predicted by classic models of cell cycle progression and differentiation. However, they do not support the hypothesis that the expression of α-actin is related to apoptosis. We also describe a simple and reproducible method for the high-yield isolation of human lung fibroblast subsets of differing proliferative potential and phenotype.},

  abstract = {Enrichment analysis enables researchers to uncover mechanisms underlying a phenotype. However, conventional methods for enrichment analysis do not take into account protein-protein interaction information, resulting in incomplete conclusions. pathfindR is a tool for enrichment analysis utilizing active subnetworks. The main function identifies active subnetworks in a protein-protein interaction network using a user-provided list of genes and associated p values. It then performs enrichment analyses on the identified subnetworks, identifying enriched terms (i.e. pathways or, more broadly, gene sets) that possibly underlie the phenotype of interest. pathfindR also offers functionalities to cluster the enriched terms and identify representative terms in each cluster, to score the enriched terms per sample and to visualize analysis results. The enrichment, clustering and other methods implemented in pathfindR are described in detail in Ulgen E, Ozisik O, Sezerman OU. 2019. pathfindR: An R Package for Comprehensive Identification of Enriched Pathways in Omics Data Through Active Subnetworks.

  abstract = {The spatiotemporal control of gene expression is dependent on the activity of cis-acting regulatory sequences, called enhancers, which regulate target genes over variable genomic distances and, often, by skipping intermediate promoters, suggesting mechanisms that control enhancer-promoter communication. Recent genomics and imaging technologies have revealed highly complex enhancer-promoter interaction networks, whereas advanced functional studies have started interrogating the forces behind the physical and functional communication among multiple enhancers and promoters. In this review, we first summarize our current understanding of the factors involved in enhancer-promoter communication, with a particular focus on recent papers that have revealed new layers of complexities to old questions. In the second part of the review, we focus on a subset of highly connected enhancer-promoter “hubs” and discuss their potential functions in signal integration and gene regulation, as well as the putative factors that might determine their dynamics and assembly.},

  abstract = {The widely used CHARMM additive all-atom force field includes parameters for proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates. In the present paper an extension of the CHARMM force field to drug-like molecules is presented. The resulting CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) covers a wide range of chemical groups present in biomolecules and drug-like molecules, including a large number of heterocyclic scaffolds. The parametrization philosophy behind the force field focuses on quality at the expense of transferability, with the implementation concentrating on an extensible force field. Statistics related to the quality of the parametrization with a focus on experimental validation are presented. Additionally, the parametrization procedure, described fully in the present paper in the context of the model systems, pyrrolidine, and 3-phenoxymethylpyrrolidine will allow users to readily extend the force field to chemical groups that are not explicitly covered in the force field as well as add functional groups to and link together molecules already available in the force field. CGenFF thus makes it possible to perform “all-CHARMM” simulations on drug-target interactions thereby extending the utility of CHARMM force fields to medicinally relevant systems.},

Il trucco del kernel consente di aggirare la necessità di specificare esplicitamente questa trasformazione non lineare. Invece, specifichi una funzione "kernel" che descrive direttamente come ogni punto si relaziona tra loro.

Feline infectious peritonitis, a fatal coronavirus infection in cats, was successfully treated previously with a prodrug GC376, a dipeptide-based protease inhibitor. Here, we show the prodrug and its parent GC373, are effective inhibitors of the Mpro from both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with these inhibitors have a covalent modification of the nucleophilic Cys145. NMR analysis reveals that inhibition proceeds via reversible formation of a hemithioacetal. GC373 and GC376 are potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. They are strong drug candidates for the treatment of human coronavirus infections because they have already been successful in animals. The work here lays the framework for their use in human trials for the treatment of COVID-19.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Activation of microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, is a prominent pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the gene expression changes underlying microglia activation in response to tau pathology remain elusive. Furthermore, it is not clear how murine gene expression changes relate to human gene expression networks. METHODS: Microglia cells were isolated from rTg4510 tau transgenic mice and gene expression was profiled using RNA sequencing. Four age groups of mice (2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-months) were analyzed to capture longitudinal gene expression changes that correspond to varying levels of pathology, from minimal tau accumulation to massive neuronal loss. Statistical and system biology approaches were used to analyze the genes and pathways that underlie microglia activation. Differentially expressed genes were compared to human brain co-expression networks. RESULTS: Statistical analysis of RNAseq data indicated that more than 4000 genes were differentially expressed in rTg4510 microglia compared to wild type microglia, with the majority of gene expression changes occurring between 2- and 4-months of age. These genes belong to four major clusters based on their temporal expression pattern. Genes involved in innate immunity were continuously up-regulated, whereas genes involved in the glutamatergic synapse were down-regulated. Up-regulated innate inflammatory pathways included NF-κB signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, lysosome, oxidative phosphorylation, and phagosome. NF-κB and cytokine signaling were among the earliest pathways activated, likely driven by the RELA, STAT1 and STAT6 transcription factors. The expression of many AD associated genes such as APOE and TREM2 was also altered in rTg4510 microglia cells. Differentially expressed genes in rTg4510 microglia were enriched in human neurodegenerative disease associated pathways, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, and highly overlapped with the microglia and endothelial modules of human brain transcriptional co-expression networks. CONCLUSION: This study revealed temporal transcriptome alterations in microglia cells in response to pathological tau perturbation and provides insight into the molecular changes underlying microglia activation during tau mediated neurodegeneration.},

  abstract = {The viral proteases have proven to be the most selective and useful for removing the fusion tags in fusion protein expression systems. As a key enzyme in the viral life-cycle, the main protease (Mpro) is most attractive for drug design targeting the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the etiological agent responsible for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. In this study, SARS-CoV Mpro was used to specifically remove the GST tag in a new fusion protein expression system. We report a new method to produce wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV Mpro with authentic N and C termini, and compare the activity of WT protease with those of three different types of SARS-CoV Mpro with additional residues at the N or C terminus. Our results show that additional residues at the N terminus, but not at the C terminus, of Mpro are detrimental to enzyme activity. To explain this, the crystal structures of WT SARS-CoV Mpro and its complex with a Michael acceptor inhibitor were determined to 1.6~Å and 1.95~Å resolution respectively. These crystal structures reveal that the first residue of this protease is important for sustaining the substrate-binding pocket and inhibitor binding. This study suggests that SARS-CoV Mpro could serve as a new tag-cleavage endopeptidase for protein overproduction, and the WT SARS-CoV Mpro is more appropriate for mechanistic characterization and inhibitor design.},

  abstract = {The genus Coronavirus contains about 25 species of coronaviruses (CoVs), which are important pathogens causing highly prevalent diseases and often severe or fatal in humans and animals. No licensed specific drugs are available to prevent their infection. Different host receptors for cellular entry, poorly conserved structural proteins (antigens), and the high mutation and recombination rates of CoVs pose a significant problem in the development of wide-spectrum anti-CoV drugs and vaccines. CoV main proteases (Mpros), which are key enzymes in viral gene expression and replication, were revealed to share a highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket by comparison of four crystal structures and a homology model representing all three genetic clusters of the genus Coronavirus. This conclusion was further supported by enzyme activity assays. Mechanism-based irreversible inhibitors were designed, based on this conserved structural region, and a uniform inhibition mechanism was elucidated from the structures of Mpro-inhibitor complexes from severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. A structure-assisted optimization program has yielded compounds with fast in vitro inactivation of multiple CoV Mpros, potent antiviral activity, and extremely low cellular toxicity in cell-based assays. Further modification could rapidly lead to the discovery of a single agent with clinical potential against existing and possible future emerging CoV-related diseases.},

However, biological circuit engineers will have to confront their inability to predict the precise behavior of even the most simple synthetic networks, a serious shortcoming and challenge for the design and construction of more sophisticated genetic circuitry in the future. We propose a combined rational and evolutionary design strategy for constructing genetic regulatory circuits, an approach that allows the engineer to fine-tune the biochemical parameters of the networks experimentally               in vivo               . By applying directed evolution to genes comprising a simple genetic circuit, we demonstrate that a nonfunctional circuit containing improperly matched components can evolve rapidly into a functional one. In the process, we generated a library of genetic devices with a range of behaviors that can be used to construct more complex circuits.},

However, the molecular mechanisms that drive de novo organization remain unknown1,2. Here, by combining chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP–seq), 3D DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (3D DNA FISH) and polymer simulations, we show that heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) is essential for de novo 3D genome organization during Drosophila early development. The binding of HP1a at pericentromeric heterochromatin is required to establish clustering of pericentromeric regions. Moreover, HP1a binding within chromosome arms is responsible for overall chromosome folding and has an important role in the formation of B-compartment regions. However, depletion of HP1a does not affect the A-compartment, which suggests that a different molecular mechanism segregates active chromosome regions. Our work identifies HP1a as an epigenetic regulator that is involved in establishing the global structure of the genome in the early embryo.},

The comprehensive elucidation of Drosophila gene networks provides an unprecedented opportunity to apply quantitative models to metazoan enhancers that govern complex patterns of gene expression during development. Models based on the fractional occupancy of defined DNA binding sites have been used to describe the regulation of the lac operon in E. coli and the lysis/lysogeny switch of phage lambda. Here, we apply similar models to enhancers regulated by the Dorsal gradient in the ventral neurogenic ectoderm (vNE) of the early Drosophila embryo. Quantitative models based on the fractional occupancy of Dorsal, Twist, and Snail binding sites raise the possibility that cooperative interactions among these regulatory proteins mediate subtle differences in the vNE expression patterns. Variations in cooperativity may be attributed to differences in the detailed linkage of Dorsal, Twist, and Snail binding sites in vNE enhancers. We propose that binding site occupancy is the key rate-limiting step for establishing localized patterns of gene expression in the early Drosophila embryo.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of β-amyloid aggregates deposited as senile plaques and by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein. To date, there is a broad consensus on the idea that neuroinflammation is one of the most important component in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Chemokines and their receptors, beside the well-known role in the immune system, are widely expressed in the nervous system, where they play a significant role in the neuroinflammatory processes. Prokineticins are a new family of chemokine-like molecules involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes including immunity, pain, inflammation, and neuroinflammation. Prokineticin 2 (PROK2) and its receptors PKR1 and PKR2 are widely expressed in the central nervous system in both neuronal and glial cells. In Alzheimer’s disease, PROK2 sustains the neuroinflammatory condition and contributes to neurotoxicity, since its expression is strongly upregulated by amyloid-β peptide and reversed by the PKR antagonist PC1. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the neurotoxic and/or neuroprotective function of chemokines in Alzheimer’s disease, focusing on the prokineticin system: it represents a new field of investigation that can stimulate the research of innovative pharmacotherapeutic strategies.},
